5ff16db6a3fbf9e72f02985529ccd2e0,"[DOC 1] An Italian man suffering from frostbite and four other tourists were rescued in the Alaska wilderness after visiting an abandoned bus that has become a lure for adventurers since it was featured in the “Into the Wild” book and movie. Alaska State Troopers say the five Italians were rescued Saturday from a camp they set up after visiting the dilapidated bus on the Stampede Trail near the interior town of Healy.

The rescue was the latest episode involving the bus, first made famous by Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book Into the Wild and then by Sean Penn’s 2007 film of the same name.(Movie still)

The hikers were found 13 miles from the trailhead, Trooper spokesman Tim DeSpain said. He didn’t know how far they were from the bus.

One of the hikers had frostbite to his feet and was transported to Fairbanks for treatment, DeSpain said. The hiker’s injuries are not considered life-threatening. The other four hikers were picked up by friends in Healy.

Rescuers were alerted by the hikers with a satellite-based emergency device that notified the International Emergency Response Coordination Center of a medical emergency, troopers said. That international group then notified rescuers, who reached the site by snowmobile, DeSpain said.

The rescue was the latest episode involving the bus, first made famous by Jon Krakauer’s book published in 1996 and then by Sean Penn’s 2007 film of the same name. Both fueled a lingering mystique about a young idealist, Christopher McCandless, who met his death from starvation in the bus, which is about 10 miles north of the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve. Over the years, some hikers have been rescued and others have died while trying to retrace McCandless’ last steps. In July, a newlywed woman from Belarus died after she was swept away by the Teklanika River while trying to reach the bus with her husband.

In 2013, three German hikers trying to reach the bus were rescued after a river they crossed became impassable because of high, fast-moving water. Families of some of those who died are now behind a proposal before Denali Borough for a feasibility study for construction of a footbridge over the Teklanika.

The idea is in the early stages, and no decision has been made. But borough Mayor Clay Walker said there are several concerns among officials. A footbridge might give people a false sense of security. It could lead to more people trying to reach the bus, and that could lead to more rescues, Walker said.

There are more hazards in the unforgiving wilderness surrounding the bus, as Saturday’s rescue illustrates.

“A footbridge wouldn’t have changed the need for a rescue,” Walker said. As far as he’s concerned, a better solution would be to remove the bus. “The fact that the bus is there raises that attraction level,” he said.","Five Italian tourists were rescued from Alaska’s wilderness after visiting the infamous bus featured in *Into the Wild*. One hiker suffered frostbite and was taken to Fairbanks, while the others were picked up by friends. The group used a satellite emergency device to call for help. The bus, located near Healy on the Stampede Trail, gained fame through Jon Krakauer’s book and Sean Penn’s film about Christopher McCandless, who died there in 1992. The site has attracted adventurers, leading to multiple rescues and fatalities. Officials are debating constructing a footbridge or removing the bus to reduce risks and discourage visits.

This included around 1,500 mobile numbers from Panchkula district complainants.The SCB has also prepared a list of all such mobile numbers district-wise and are planning to trace other mobile numbers through IMEI linkage analysis with the help of field units.

But in an early, well-judged interview to Italyâ€™s leading newspaper La Republica, Gandhi has firmly established the rules of the game: No interviews in Italian. No response to ""feelings as an Italian"".

In a remarkable balancing act that Italians are reading as a gentle, if understandable put-down to the country of her birth, Gandhi granted one of her first post-victory interviews to La Republica, Italy''s leading centre-left daily.

With a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi behind her, raved La Republica''s Asia correspondent Raimundo Bultrini, Gandhi conducted a long and earnest conversation â€“ but significantly, in English.

Reported Bultrini, ""she asked that the conversation be in English because after so many years, her Italian is not so good anymore. Gandhi went on to bat aside the first, potentially-loaded question: ""What do you feel as an Italian, a Hindu and the winner of elections?""

The Congress president bluntly replied, First of all, I have no feeling as an Italian. Because I feel Indian. I am Indian"". Despite Gandhi''s careful straddling of the delicate Italian-Indian line, La Republica''s amazing upsurge of emotion and interest was reflected across the country.

Both this paper and the more moderate Corriera della sierra front-paged Gandhi''s win with the lyrical headline ""An Italian triumph in India"".

La Republica sympathetically highlighted Gandhi''s defiance against ""attacks on me (Sonia) because for Indians, I am one of them"".

And in a flush of emotion it deputed a reporter to visit Gandhi''s home village of Orbassanolan, near Turin, only to report that this Piedmontese region of Italy feels a mix of ""pride and fear for Sonia''s life"".

In possibly an exclusive interview, the paper quotes Sonia''s niece, Aruna Vinci to say ""My aunt is an exceptional woman. Not many would have stayed in India after all that happened to her family and kept believing in the same mission. But she did and the Indians understood that and gave her a prize for that"".

Meanwhile, La Stampa, published out of Turin, just down the road from Sonia''s childhood home, the via Bellini, asked the key question: ""Who is Sonia Maino destined to guide the greatest democracy of the world?""

Offering a brief potted guide to the life and times of Sonia''s builder father, Stefano Eugene Maino, it concludes with the news that Orbassano''s mayor Carl Browns is desperately searching for an address to send a congratulatory telegram to the region''s most famous daughter.

""Kind Mrs. Sonia Maino Gandhi, we are much happy by your election and hope that soon you can return to visit your city d''origine"", the paper quotes Browns to say.","Sonia Gandhi's ascension to power in India has captured Italy's attention, but she's made it clear in an interview with La Republica that she identifies as Indian, declining to engage with her Italian roots or feelings.

1be8e64285fb18614bb58ae7ef236526,"[DOC 1] Kalaburagi: Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge has strongly criticised the Union government for flooding the Indian market with cheap, low-quality tur dal imports, alleging that the move has severely undermined domestic farmers, particularly those in Karnataka. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kharge accused the Modi-led government of neglecting the country’s agrarian economy and abandoning the promise of doubling farmers’ income. He took aim at BJP leaders from Karnataka, especially Union Ministers, for remaining silent on the issue and failing to safeguard the interests of their own state’s farmers. “A decade ago, the BJP came to power with grand promises of doubling farmers’ incomes and building an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Today, those promises lie in ruins,” Kharge said. “BJP’s Union Ministers from Karnataka appear more focused on peddling hate than standing up for the rightful interests of the state they represent.” Karnataka is the largest tur dal-producing state in India, contributing over 40 percent of national output, with Kalaburagi district alone producing the majority of the state's yield. The region is known for the GI-tagged Kalaburagi Tur, prized for its quality. Kharge pointed out that in the 2024–25 season, India produced 35 lakh metric tonnes of tur, but the Centre procured less than 10 percent of it. Karnataka alone produced 10 lakh quintals, but farmers were forced to sell at ₹6,000 per quintal—well below the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of ₹7,550—resulting in an estimated loss of ₹1,550 crore. ""This year’s MSP has been raised to ₹8,000, but market prices have crashed to ₹6,250, nearly half of last year’s rates,"" Kharge said. ""Why? Because the Centre is flooding the market with cheap, low-quality tur from abroad, turning its back on our farmers.” He also criticised the Centre’s decision to keep tur imports duty-free since May 2021, a policy extended until March 2026. According to Kharge, over 13 lakh metric tonnes of tur were imported in 2024–25, and the government has signed MoUs to bring in an additional 2 lakh metric tonnes from countries like Mozambique. Kharge cited the Centre's own Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) report, which noted Karnataka had demanded an MSP of ₹16,548, based on a production cost of ₹11,032. However, the Centre fixed the MSP at ₹8,000. Calling the Centre’s import policy “shocking” and “anti-farmer,” Kharge demanded immediate corrective measures to protect the livelihoods of Indian farmers and restore price stability in the market.","Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge has slammed the Union government for importing cheap, low-quality tur dal, which he says has devastated domestic farmers—particularly in Karnataka. Posting on social media platform X, Kharge accused the Modi-led government of abandoning its promises to double farmers’ incomes and build an Atmanirbhar Bharat. He criticized BJP Union Ministers from Karnataka for remaining silent on policies that, he claims, betray their own state’s agricultural community.

Karnataka, the largest tur dal-producing state in India, has seen its farmers suffer severe financial losses. Despite producing 10 lakh quintals in 2024–25, many farmers were forced to sell at ₹6,000 per quintal—well below the MSP of ₹7,550—resulting in an estimated loss of ₹1,550 crore. Though the MSP has been raised to ₹8,000 this year, market prices have dropped to ₹6,250, further compounding the crisis.

Kharge blamed this price crash on the Centre's decision to allow duty-free tur imports since May 2021, recently extended to March 2026. Over 13 lakh metric tonnes of tur were imported in 2024–25, with more on the way from countries like Mozambique. Calling the policy “anti-farmer,” he urged immediate action to restore price stability and protect farmer livelihoods."
cc2473512cb81ec8ed2dc128ccb3063c,"[DOC 1] A federal court jury has decided that Google's Android app store has been protected by anticompetitive barriers that have damaged smartphone consumers and software developers, dealing a blow to a major pillar of a technology empire.
The unanimous verdict reached Monday came after just three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial revolving around a lucrative payment system within Google's Play store. The store is the main place where hundreds of millions of people around the world download and install apps that work on smartphones powered by Google's Android software.Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed a lawsuit against Google three years ago, alleging that the internet search giant has been abusing its power to shield its Play Store from competition in order to protect a gold mine that makes billions of dollars annually. Just as Apple does for its iPhone app store, Google collects a commission ranging from 15 per cent to 30 per cent on digital transactions completed within apps.Apple prevailed in a similar case that Epic brought against the iPhone app store. But that 2021 trial was decided by a federal judge in a ruling that is under appeal at the US Supreme Court.
The nine-person jury in the Play store case apparently saw things through a different lens, even though Google technically allows Android apps to be downloaded from different stores an option that Apple prohibits on the iPhone.
Just before the Play store trial started, Google sought to avoid having a jury determine the outcome, only to have its request rejected by US District Judge James Donato. Now it will be up to Donato to determine what steps Google will have to take to unwind its illegal behaviour in the Play Store. The judge indicated he will hold hearings on the issue during the second week of January.Epic CEO Tim Sweeney broke into a wide grin after the verdict was read and slapped his lawyers on the back and also shook the hand of a Google attorney, whom he thanked for his professional attitude during the proceedings.
""Victory over Google!"" Sweeney wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In a company post, Epic hailed the verdict as ""a win for all app developers and consumers around the world."" Google plans to appeal the verdict, according to a statement from Wilson White, the company's vice president of government affairs and public policy.

""The competition between the app stores is tied to the competition between the phones."" But Bornstein ridiculed the notion of Google and Android competing against Apple and its incompatible iPhone software system. ""Apple is not the get out of jail for free' card that Google wants it to be,"" Bornstein told the jury.
Google also pointed to rival Android app stores such as the one that Samsung installs on its popular smartphones as evidence of a free market. Combined with the rival app stores pre-installed on devices made by other companies, more than 60 per cent of Android phones offer alternative outlets for Android apps.Epic, though, presented evidence asserting the notion that Google welcomes competition as a pretense, citing the hundreds of billions of dollars it has doled out to companies, such as game maker Activision Blizzard, to discourage them from opening rival app stores. Besides making these payments, Bornstein also urged the jury to consider the Google ""scare screens"" that pop up warning consumers of potential security threats when they try to download Android apps from some of the alternatives to the Play Store.
""These are classic anticompetitive strategies used by dominant firms to protect their monopolies,"" Bornstein said.
Google's empire could be further undermined by another major antitrust trial in Washington that will be decided by a federal judge after hearing final arguments in May. That trial has cast a spotlight on Google's cozy relationship with Apple in online search, the technology that turned Google into a household word a few years after two former Stanford University graduate students started the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.

","A federal court jury has ruled that Google's Android app store has been protected by anticompetitive barriers, damaging smartphone consumers and software developers. The verdict came after a four-week trial involving a lucrative payment system within Google's Play store. Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed a lawsuit against Google three years ago, alleging that the internet search giant has been abusing its power to shield its Play Store from competition to protect a gold mine that makes billions of dollars annually. Google collects a commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within apps. The nine-person jury in the Play store case saw things through a different lens, even though Google technically allows Android apps to be downloaded from different stores, an option Apple prohibits on the iPhone. Google plans to appeal the verdict, stating that Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform."

Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh today ruled out financial help to private carriers but indicated relief to some in the form of opening up 49 per cent foreign investment in the cash-strapped sector.

A tough talking minister also advised national carrier Air India to get its act together if it wanted to survive in the long run. “Air India is a public sector unit, so the government has an obligation. However, Air India will have to become competitive. They will have to restructure their costs in line with the industry as a whole because the government cannot keep pouring money into it,” he said.

Private airlines, however, will have to learn to fend for themselves. This was his clear message to Vijay Mallya, ruling out a bailout for either Kingfisher Airlines or any other cash-strapped private carrier hoping for such clemency from the government.

“Kingfisher is a private enterprise and banks can only lend if they are satisfied with the business plan of the company. If the banks feel they can recover their money and make profits, they will lend, otherwise not,” he said when asked if the government was willing to give financial support to the Mallya-promoted airline.

Kingfisher had recently sought Singh’s help, saying that the company would not be able to sustain the present scale of operations it did not get government help soon.

The silver lining for struggling-for-survival airlines is that Ajit Singh is in favour of allowing foreign companies to buy equity in Indian carriers, a demand being pursued mostly by Mallya who feels that FDI would help them raise the much- needed equity. “Yes, I am in favour of 49 per cent FDI,” the Civil Aviation Minister categorically told The Tribune.

The idea to increase the FDI cap from the earlier proposed 26 per cent to 49 per cent was recently mooted by a committee of secretaries. The Group of Ministers (GoM) is likely to discuss the issue in a day or two.

“Finally, the Cabinet will take the decision. The Committee of Secretaries has recommended raising the FDI limit in the sector,” Singh said.

However, apart from Mallya, there are not many takers for the move.

Carriers like Jet Airways and IndiGo feel that FDI above 24 per cent would make them susceptible to hostile takeovers in difficult financial situations. Ajit Singh, however, gave an assurance that there would be enough safeguards to take care of such concerns.

Under the current rules, up to 49 per cent FDI is allowed in aviation companies, but foreign airlines are not allowed to invest. When Vayalar Ravi was in charge, the Civil Aviation Ministry had proposed 24 per cent FDI, a suggestion that was countered by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).","Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh ruled out financial aid to private airlines like Kingfisher, emphasizing that they must become financially viable on their own. He suggested that Air India, as a public sector entity, needed to restructure and become competitive to survive without continuous government funding. Singh supported increasing the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the aviation sector from 26% to 49%, aiming to attract foreign equity to bolster struggling airlines. The move, endorsed by a committee of secretaries, awaits Cabinet approval despite concerns from carriers like Jet Airways and IndiGo about potential hostile takeovers under higher FDI limits."

4b6631a7884e256427a81ff52f8609b6,"[DOC 1] India, a nation with a rich cultural heritage and diverse population, faces a significant challenge in the form of malnutrition, particularly among its children and women. In the last nine years, the government of India has implemented several schemes aimed at addressing this pressing issue. However, despite these efforts, malnutrition remains a critical concern.Rashtriya Poshan Maah 2023 is harnessing the power of Jan Bhagidari through people’s participation under various themes. Diverse activities like Swasth Balak Spardha, Anaemia camps, and Poshan Bhi Padhai Bhi registered a record number of activities just in a day on the Jan Andolan dashboard.Since the launch of POSHAN Abhiyaan in March 2018, the nation has embarked on nationwide Jan Andolans focused on nutrition for the very first time. These annual Jan Andolans under POSHAN Abhiyaan are carefully curated to promote behavioural changes, particularly as regards consumption of essential nutritious foods extending to the grassroots level. They are designed to target specific beneficiaries, namely pregnant women, lactating mothers, adolescent girls, and children up to 6 years of age.

The Jan Andolans is celebrated twice annually, during Poshan Maah in September and Poshan Pakhwada in March-April. To date, 10 Jan Andolans have been successfully celebrated (5 for each Maah and Pakhwada), recording more than 60 crore sensitization activities. This demonstrates the increasing and sustained participation across the country since 2018.

Currently, the nation is observing the 6th Rashtriya Poshan Maah, organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. This event demonstrates the strength of collaboration with various key ministries and departments for maximum outreach. In the first 12 days of these ongoing celebrations, over 6 crore activities have been registered on the Jan Andolan dashboard across the country.

Throughout this month-long event, diverse stakeholders are actively participating to improve ground-level nutrition outcomes and encourage behavioural changes. Ministries such as Rural Development, Health & Family Welfare, and Panchayati Raj are leading, with the Ministry of Rural Development alone recording more than 6 lakh activities under Rashritya Poshan Maah 2023.

The current campaign is focusing on key themes, including exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding, Swasth Balak Spardha, growth measurement, and sensitization of tribal communities to millet, local food, and traditional food for addressing malnutrition challenges like anaemia, among others.

In terms of specific sensitization activities, the Swasth Balak Spardha/Growth measurement drive has registered the highest number of activities at 15 lakhs, followed by sensitization activities on growth monitoring and “Food Resource Mapping” within the village boundaries, which stand at close to 14 lakh activities. Additionally, anaemia camps for children, adolescent girls, and women in tribal districts recorded more than 12 lakh activities, with 11 lakh home visits focusing on ECCE, especially engaging parents.

Collectively, through each Jan Andolan and its unique participatory sensitization activities, steady progress is being made towards making nutrition a part of Jan Bhagidari. Poshan Abhiyaan 2.0 aims at improving the nutritional status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Resting on the pillars of convergence, governance, and capacity building, Poshan 2.0 aims to contribute to the human capital development of the country, address challenges of malnutrition, promote nutrition awareness, develop good eating habits for sustainable health and well-being, and address nutrition-related deficiencies.

Poshan Abhiyaan 2.0 aims to benefit approximately 11.80 crore children studying in 11.20 lakh schools nationwide. This initiative extends mid-day meals to Balvatika children, in addition to those in classes 1 to 8 in government and government-aided schools, aligning with the National Education Policy 2020. The scheme integrates Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and Women Self-Help Groups to champion the “vocal for local” philosophy, advancing the objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat, India’s self-reliance initiative. To ensure the effective implementation of the National Nutrition Mission, social audits are made mandatory for every school in every district, engaging university and college students in field visits to monitor progress. Poshan Abhiyaan promotes the establishment of nutrition gardens in schools to provide additional micronutrients to students. It encourages schools to organise cooking competitions based on locally available vegetables. States are empowered to include supplementary items based on local needs, such as milk, fruits, or vegetables, with central approval, especially in regions with a high prevalence of anemia. Poshan Abhiyaan introduces “Tithi Bhojan,” encouraging students from private schools to share their meals with underprivileged children at least once a month, fostering community participation and empathy.

The Modi government is providing free food grains to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next year. This initiative is set to improve access, affordability, and availability of entitled food grains for approximately 81 crore beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Importantly, it will alleviate the financial burden on the poorest of the poor, removing barriers to their access to nutritious food. The government’s food subsidy expense for the next year under NFSA and other welfare schemes is expected to exceed INR 2 lakh crore ($24.5 billion), underscoring the significance of this commitment. Awareness-generation activities like the “Eat Right India” campaign are implemented to promote healthy eating habits among schoolchildren and the wider community. This campaign emphasises the importance of eating healthy, safe, and sustainable food. In 2019, the Modi government launched the One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme, a citizen-centric and technology-driven initiative aimed at simplifying access to food. This innovative system facilitates the portability of ration cards within and across states, ensuring that families can access their entitled food grains regardless of their location. ONORC has already made strides in enhancing food and nutritional security for priority households.

As the Modi government is in its ninth year in office, the Poshan Abhiyan stands as a testament to its commitment to the well-being of women and children, demonstrating significant progress in the quest for holistic health and nutrition across the nation. The Modi government’s commitment to addressing malnutrition through various schemes is commendable. However, the prevalence of malnutrition persists due to complex factors such as poverty, inadequate access to clean water, changing dietary patterns, and seasonal migrations. To effectively combat malnutrition, it is crucial to continue implementing and enhancing these schemes while simultaneously addressing the root causes of malnutrition. This includes efforts to alleviate poverty, improve sanitation and hygiene, promote healthy eating habits, and support traditional crop cultivation. A holistic approach that combines government initiatives with community involvement is essential to ensuring the health and well-being of India’s children and women.

The Modi government recognizes the vital role nutrition plays in the lives of children and is committed to addressing malnutrition through various schemes and programs. These initiatives not only provide supplementary nutrition but also promote awareness about healthy eating habits and overall well-being. By focusing on the nutritional needs of children and ensuring access to balanced meals, India aims to secure a healthier and brighter future for its young citizens. These initiatives collectively contribute to the government’s efforts to combat malnutrition and promote a culture of good nutrition and healthy living among children across the country.

India’s commitment to these initiatives is not only a testament to its dedication to its citizens but also a significant step towards fulfilling its global commitment under Sustainable Development Goal 2—ensuring zero hunger. This commitment takes on added significance as the world grapples with food insecurity driven by global disruptions.","The article highlights India's ongoing efforts to address malnutrition, particularly among children and women. Despite various schemes and initiatives over the past nine years, malnutrition remains a significant concern.

Free food grain distribution to Antyodaya and priority households under the National Food Security Act is extended, aiming to alleviate financial burdens and ensure access to nutritious food. The Modi government's commitment to holistic health and nutrition is evident, though challenges persist, requiring a continued, holistic approach that addresses root causes. The initiatives align with global goals, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 2—zero hunger."

The expedition began from Kibithu in Anjaw district on 27 January. The duo rode a limited distance of 75 kms, up to Hawai, on day one to acclimatize. They will bicycle all the way to Koteshwar in Gujarat, cutting across seven states, and are likely to cover a distance of 3,800 kms in a little over two weeks, averaging 200 kms per day.

“Our aim is to cycle almost 175-200 kms per day. The rains and high altitude bring their own unique levels of difficulty and make it extremely challenging with cold head winds,” said Mohsin.

“Middle-aged women are too tied up and scared to take up challenges. I hope we are able to encourage them to break their shell and experience the fun of outdoor activities. Even if they set out to walk, jog or cycle, it would be just great,” said Velankar.

When asked how tough it is, Velankar said, “Managing temperature variations in short span is tough. Cycling in mountains in freezing cold to high temperatures in Gujarat will be a challenge. We will have to throw away heavy winter clothing as we cycle into the plains.”

Mohsin added: “It is scary at times when for miles together we don’t see anything on the roads. We are so used to seeing people, vehicles and roadside stalls, but the hilly regions of Arunachal Pradesh are completely deserted.”

 Velankar (45) is a seasoned long distance endurance rider, and holds a PhD in life sciences. She is a mother of two daughters. Mohsin (42) is also an endurance rider. She is a mother of two children, and an architect-interior designer by profession.","Meera Velankar and Tasneem Mohsin, cyclists from Bangalore, are embarking on a 3,800-km expedition across India from east to west.

442ea1177dea3e4e307b90d45c22b478,"[DOC 1] In a far-reaching decision, the Ministry of Health, Medical Council of India and the CBSE have agreed to conduct a common all-India entrance test for admission to all medical colleges across the country from next year.

From 2012, the CBSE will conduct the proposed common medical entrance test for entry to all private and government medical colleges in India (close to 300 colleges of which about 180 are private).

Close to 8 lakh students take UG medical entrance tests annually but at present they sit for different tests, including the All India PMT which the CBSE conducts and various state-level medical entrance tests. The decision now is that the CBSE will hold one test; it has the experience of conducing the largest entrance test in India - AIEEE for engineering entrance which close to 11 lakh students take every year.

A common test will ensure uniformity in UG medical education across states where private colleges are in the practice of charging exorbitant sums for admitting students. This arbitrariness in UG medical admissions has resulted in seats being sold and purchased.

The MCI will prepare the course structure for the test and put it on the website for comments of people, said MCI BOG member DR Purushottam Lal. The decision, he said, came in the wake of the Supreme Court orders to the MCI to go ahead with one test for UG medical admissions to avoid stress to students.

One test will ensure quality students entering medical education because states would be obliged to fill seats in their respective jurisdictions with students who figure in the All-India merit list. They would be free to prefer students from their areas but they won’t be able to compromise on merit.

Earlier Tamil Nadu had opposed the move and secured a stay on it from the High Court. The Health Ministry subsequently asked the MCI to withdraw the common entrance test notification but the Supreme Court told the MCI to go ahead. At the latest meeting which Health Secretary attended, the view was that state governments would be roped in to build a consensus on the matter.","Starting in 2012, the Ministry of Health, Medical Council of India (MCI), and CBSE will implement a common all-India entrance test for admission to all medical colleges, both private and government. The CBSE, which already conducts the large-scale AIEEE for engineering, will oversee this new test. Approximately 8 lakh students take various medical entrance tests annually, but the new unified test aims to ensure uniformity and merit-based admissions, addressing issues of exorbitant fees and arbitrary admissions in private colleges. The MCI will design the test structure, which will be open for public comments. Despite initial opposition from Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court has supported the move, and state governments will be encouraged to build consensus on the matter."
70e409fe030823c2d2180c206bd1291a,"[DOC 1] Ten-year benchmark government bond was the most profitable and liquid security among sovereign bonds in the market and every investor who picked this bond at its maiden auction was guaranteed a gain. But not any more.

Perhaps for the third time in a decade, a newly issued 10-year benchmark government bond is what traders term “out of the money” now. In other words, everyone who fought to get hold of this paper on the May 22 maiden auction, is running a mark-to-market loss currently.

“Most bonds are out of the money right now as yields have risen across the curve. The volatility in global bond markets and with inflation data due, people do not want to make big bets,” said Jayesh Mehta, head of treasury at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.

The 7.72%, 2025 bond settled at a yield of 7.88% on Thursday, 16 basis points above the cut-off yield at which it was issued on May 22. If an investor had bought R100 worth of the bond, he finished Thursday with an mark-to-market loss of R1.09. The bond has been auctioned twice and the floating stock for trading in the market is at R16,000 crore now.

“The market will watch for comments from the Fed because a large part of the pressure is from the global sell-off in bonds,” said NS Venkatesh, the executive director at IDBI Bank.

Bond traders said yields across the curve have risen, owing to the scare on monsoon deficiency and a global bond sell-off that continues, and the 10-year benchmark is no exception. “Long-term bonds have fallen far more than the 10-year benchmark. Portfolios are getting hit across the curve,” said a senior bond trader at a private bank.

Bond yields from the US to Europe have risen to multi-month highs as investors dumped fixed income amid rising oil prices and the imminent rate hike by the Federal Reserve in 2015. Domestic bond yields have mirrored the move in global yields over the last one week.","The newly issued 10-year benchmark government bond, auctioned on May 22, has turned unprofitable for investors, marking a mark-to-market loss due to rising yields across the bond market. The 7.72%, 2025 bond settled at a yield of 7.88%, resulting in a loss for investors who bought it at the maiden auction. Global bond sell-offs, fears of monsoon deficiency, and anticipation of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve have contributed to the rise in bond yields globally and domestically. Traders are cautious amid market volatility and await further developments, especially comments from the Fed. The bond market reflects the impact of these factors, with portfolios experiencing losses across the curve."

46f05265dc193ef7260263efce366752,"[DOC 1] India's healthcare sector is likely to get the maximum attention of the Government in the upcoming Budget to be unveiled on Monday, as it comes in the face of the country braving a once-in-a-century global pandemic, says a survey. 

The Assocham-Primus Partners survey covered more than 550 industry participants, and 39.7 per cent respondents said healthcare would receive the highest priority in terms of resource allocation and policy support in the Budget. 

Manufacturing emerged as the second key sector expected to be in focus, with 14.7 per cent respondents expecting it to receive the Finance Minister's attention, followed by MSMEs (11.4 per cent), real estate (10.7 per cent) and infrastructure (9.6 per cent).

“The Covid-19 pandemic tested the limits of the global healthcare system. While the government's proactive measures and the frontline workers' tireless efforts have helped tide the way, the pandemic has also brought forth the fragility of the healthcare system,"" the survey stated. On measures which can strengthen the healthcare and pharma sector, 67.3 per cent respondents expect the allocation of a fund to modernise existing primary healthcare infrastructure. 

This was followed by an expectation (by 62.9 per cent) that the government should increase investments in creating new primary healthcare infrastructure. With regard to aspirations of individual taxpayers, 79.3 per cent respondents said they would like to see a cut in personal income tax rates, especially in the wake of pressure on their earnings in the pandemic-hit economy.

While corporate tax rates have been reduced, individuals pay taxes at higher rates. Rationalising taxes for the individuals is critical as reducing the tax burden on individuals would enable further spending. According to the survey, this much-needed push to demand would help in creating a multiplier effect in the economy. 

""A significant increase in the public expenditure is inevitable. The pandemic has taught us there are no choices other than large scale public investment in building primary health centres, hospitals at the district, state capital level,"" Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said.

As has been stated in the Economic Survey, there is a strong feeling within the government to raise public expenditure on healthcare three-fold from 1 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent of GDP, he added. ","A recent Assocham-Primus Partners survey indicates that India's healthcare sector is likely to receive the highest priority in the upcoming Budget, driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among 550 industry participants, 39.7% expect healthcare to get the maximum attention in terms of resource allocation and policy support. Manufacturing (14.7%), MSMEs (11.4%), real estate (10.7%), and infrastructure (9.6%) follow.

The pandemic exposed the fragility of the healthcare system, prompting 67.3% of respondents to call for modernization of primary healthcare infrastructure, and 62.9% to seek investments in new facilities. Additionally, 79.3% of respondents advocated for a reduction in personal income tax rates to ease financial strain and boost demand.

Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood emphasized the need for significant public investment in healthcare, echoing the Economic Survey’s suggestion to increase healthcare spending from 1% to 3% of GDP.

e2622b47751928c97eee03f394756446,"[DOC 1] India as the second-largest buyer of gold in the world can play a crucial role in the global economic order as central banks are still buying the precious metal in large quantities, Alok Kumar Choudhary, Managing Director, State Bank of India (SBI), said on Friday.

“We have also seen how India can be the fulcrum in setting up global economic corridor,” he said while addressing the 15th International Gold Economic Forum organised here by ASSOCHAM.


While the gold standard might not be in place anymore, several banks including the RBI continue to hold gold reserves as a staple component of their overall reserves, he added.

“In an interconnected world, economic ties transcend borders and gold’s role as common accepted asset can foster a sense of stability and potentially contribute to a more integrated, co-operative global economic system. Banks as critical stakeholders in the financial ecosystem play an important role in formalising gold to ensure the integrity of the financial system,” Choudhary said.


Addressing the gathering, Dr  C Rangarajan, former Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and former RBI Governor, said: “Gold has been a tangible asset since ancient times, in all cultures and across all periods of history. While held as reserve by central banks, it no longer plays the role of intermediary in circulation. As the second largest consumer of gold, India accounts for one-fourth of the global demand. India’s import of gold was 394 tons in 2000 and 774 tons in 2022 or $135 million. In 2022-23, gold imports accounted for 52.2 per cent of the current account deficit. The current level of import duty on gold is reasonable and is among the lowest.”

 among commodities.”

Somasundaram P R, Regional CEO – India, World Gold Council, said: “Gold is a very good diversifier, it de-risks your portfolio and enables you to take more risk in other financial asset classes. India, as a gold consumer, can also be proud to have HUID technology through which every piece of jewellery hallmarked can be traced to its origins, which is aspirational in other markets.”

Suvanker Sen, Co-Chairman, National Council on Commodity Markets – ASSOCHAM, said: “Consumer behaviour over the years in India has proven that we trust in gold. The various initiatives undertaken by all stakeholders has achieved a lot but a lot more can be done. The growth of the country is closely linked with the rise of gold as an asset. The 25,000 tons of gold that is embedded in our economy is one major driver.”

S C  Aggarwal, Senior Member, Managing Committee – ASSOCHAM, said: “Gold has multiple usage, as an ornament, it is a status symbol and an investment as well. India needs around 800 tons of gold every year necessitating imports which increases our trade deficit.”","Indian gold consumption, a quarter of the global demand, remains a significant economic factor, noted at the 15th International Gold Economic Forum by State Bank of India's Managing Director, Alok Kumar Choudhary. Gold, integral to central bank reserves, plays a role in stabilizing global finance, emphasized by various speakers, recognizing India's substantial gold reliance."

The study, reported in the New Scientist journal, believes it reflects insecurities among men who are not societys ideal height. The much-talked about short man syndrome is a phenomenon where short men compensate for their lack of height by inculcating aggressive tendencies, often associated with Napoleon, Mussolini, Hitler and Attila the Hun. In the study carried out by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, researchers asked men and women how jealous they were in their current relationships. In another similar study, involving 119 male and 230 female students, the participants were quizzed on their reaction if they saw their girlfriend, or boyfriend, flirting with a stranger.   The findings suggested that shorter men were far more likely to say they were jealous than taller ones. Taller men tended to be less jealous, and the tallest men were the least jealous, the Daily Mail quoted the researchers, led by Abraham Buunk, as saying. Among the women, average-sized females were the least jealous - while tall and short women were the most. Instead the findings showed they would be more jealous of taller women possessing masculine features such as physical dominance and social status.   Repeated studies have shown that women rate taller men as more attractive and powerful than shorter ones, while men prefer average women, usually who are a couple of inches shorter than them in height.   The experts said the animal kingdom illustrated this where larger males were likely to win fights and obtain dominance and monopolise access to females. They said in humans height was one of the first noticeable features and was therefore associated with status.","- A study by the University of Groningen suggests shorter men are more likely to be jealous husbands and boyfriends.   - The research proposes that this may reflect insecurities among men who do not meet society's ideal height.   - The study involved asking men and women about their jealousy levels in their current relationships.   - Findings indicated that shorter men were more prone to expressing jealousy compared to taller men.   - Taller men tended to be less jealous, and the tallest men were the least jealous.   - Average-sized women were found to be the least jealous, while tall and short women were more jealous.   - The study also revealed that women would be more jealous of taller women with masculine features like physical dominance and social status.   - Previous studies have shown that women generally prefer taller men as more attractive and powerful, while men prefer average women slightly shorter than them.   - The researchers suggest that this behavior is influenced by evolutionary factors, where larger males are often dominant and have better access to females.   - Height is a noticeable feature associated with status, influencing perceptions and reactions in relationships."

One of the potent charges against the previous UPA government was its inability to break the legislative logjam, and the BJP, which was then in the Opposition, had milked it the most on the campaign trail.
The official amendments to the land bill, brought under pressure from the allies and the RSS, included restricting the width of land for industrial corridors, introducing public hearings for grievance redress and promising the
bare minimum land for public-private-partnership (PPP) projects. (Chart on Page 4)
In the Rajya Sabha, as soon as the minister moved the mines bill, which was passed in the Lok Sabha last week, for consideration, the members of the Congress and the CPM moved a motion to send it to the select committee.
The government passionately argued against the disruptive technique but had to give up after several adjournments through the day as the Opposition wasn't ready to relent. (See Page 4)
Although the government escaped the embarrassment of a defeat, the Opposition agreed to put off voting only when a categorical announcement was made about sending the mining bill to the select committee.
Several Opposition leaders said that the coal, land and insurance bills would get the same treatment. By adopting this tactic, the Opposition is avoiding defeating the bills, which would pave the way for a joint sitting of Parliament. In a joint session, the NDA government will have the upper hand.
","The government secured the passage of the contentious land acquisition bill in the Lok Sabha with a strong majority, despite facing opposition. However, in the Rajya Sabha, the united opposition successfully stalled the progress of a mines and minerals bill by pushing for its referral to a select committee. This demonstration of opposition unity suggests that similar tactics may be employed for other legislation, including the land bill. The government made amendments to the land bill, such as narrowing the scope of industrial corridors and introducing public hearings, in response to pressure from allies and the RSS. Despite the government's efforts to oppose the disruptive tactics in the Rajya Sabha, multiple adjournments occurred, indicating the opposition's determination. While the government avoided defeat, the opposition's strategy aims to delay legislation and prevent a joint sitting of Parliament, where the NDA government would have an advantage."

The BCCI president suffered a mild cardiac arrest on Saturday morning while he was through a routine workout session in the gym at his home, sources said, adding he experienced pain in his hand and back and then passed out for a while before being rushed to a private health facility in south Kolkata where doctors after conducting various tests, including angiogram said he had been suffering from myocardial infarction.

The former India captain would be monitored for the next 48 hours and would be required to remain in hospital for the next 4-5 days when a team of senior doctors would decide whether more angioplasty would be conducted on him or whether he would require a bypass surgery immediately.

Informing that the cricketing legend was stable, Dr Aftab Khan of the hospital where he was being treated said, “Sourav Ganguly has undergone angioplasty. He is stable now. He will be monitored for 48 hours. He is completely conscious. There are two (more) blockages in his heart for which he will be treated. As of now he is stable, we will have a meeting on Monday and then we will decide what needs to be done further, priority is to let him settle down after heart attack. He is risk-free and he is talking as well.”

Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who met him during the visiting hours “his spirit is so high … when I went to see him … before I could ask a question he asked me as to how I was … I wonder how a youngster like him can get a heart attack… I could also know after speaking to him that he would never get any test done.”

Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar with whom Banerjee met a few days ago at the

Raj Bhavan --- giving rise to speculations that the BJP wanted him as its Chief Ministerial candidate in Bengal elections --- said, “I was apprehensive before meeting him. But after seeing him in a cheerful mood I have no doubt that our Dada will recover soon. I am relieved like millions of his followers to see him in his usual cheerful mood.”

Earlier Home Minister Amit Shah too enquired about his health following which Bengal observer for the BJP Kailash Vijayvargiya called up the hospital authorities to get his information.

Cardiologist who had earlier treated his father said the disease Ganguly was suffering from could have a hereditary history adding however there could be other reasons too which are related to lifestyle.

“Normally such things should not happen to a player living under such regulated regime … however hereditary issues --- like ischmeic heart or lifestyle can cause such attacks … he might have been under strain in the past few months,” a doctor refusing to give his name said.

Meanwhile India captain Virat Kohli, who is currently on paternity leave, his former colleagues Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Mohammad Kaif, BCCI secretary Jay Shah, woman cricketer Mithali Raj and many stars from Indian cricket and other arena wished for his speedy recovery.","Sourav Ganguly, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), underwent angioplasty after suffering a mild heart attack. Doctors reported a 90% blockage in the right artery and 70% blockage in the other two arteries. Ganguly is stable and conscious, and he will be monitored for the next 48 hours. The decision regarding further treatment, including additional angioplasty or bypass surgery, will be made in a meeting on Monday. Many cricket stars and political figures, including Virat Kohli and Mamata Banerjee, have expressed wishes for Ganguly's speedy recovery."

Earlier in the day, the PM addressed two rallies in Jharkhand’s Palamu and Lohardaga and later in the evening, he held a roadshow in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur, where he continued his attack on the Opposition over corruption, votebank politics and ""attempts to change the Constitution for providing reservations to Muslims"".  against Bhojshala ASI survey Addressing his third rally of the day in Bihar’s Darbhanga, Modi raked up the 2002 Godhra train arson issue and accused Lalu Prasad of trying to “save” those responsible for burning alive more than 60 kar sevaks. “It is because of this appeasement politics that the father of Bihar's shehzada (allusion to Tejashwi Yadav) had tried to save those who were responsible for the Godhra train burning incident,"" said Modi, adding that “after all, it was the rule of Sonia madam.” Also Read - Bhujbal meets Sharad Pawar, urges him to take stand on Maratha quota issue “He (Lalu Prasad Yadav), who has himself been convicted (in fodder scam cases), was railway minister. He set up an inquiry committee and got a report, which exonerated those guilty of the horrendous crime. But the court threw the report away,"" said Modi. Kicking off his gruelling campaign schedule for the day from Palamu, Jharkhand, the PM took a dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi without naming him and said Pakistan wanted him as the Prime Minister, but India wants “a strong country with a strong government”. Also Read - SC bench to hear money bills plea ""Maa Bharati's disrespect won't be tolerated anymore.

But our strong nation wants a strong government and leader,"" Modi said at the rally to campaign for the BJP candidate from Palamu, V.D. Ram. The Prime Minister said that earlier, after any terror attack on the country, the Congress-led governments were ""helpless"". But that has changed under the strong BJP-led government at the Centre. Now, Pakistan is “seeking help from the world to save the nation”. He told the audience that their one vote had contributed to the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya after generations struggled for 500 years, as well as the scrapping of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir. “The Congress and the INDI alliance want to usurp your land. They want to snatch SC, ST and OBCs' quotas to provide reservations to Muslims by altering the Constitution. Till I am alive, I will not now allow any such design of the Congress to succeed,” he asserted. In his address, the Prime Minister claimed that over 25-crore people came out of poverty in the last 10 years of the NDA government. He said: “The Congress never bothered for the welfare of people. The party's shehzada was born with a silver spoon and poses for the camera when he visits the house of the poor. But it is my commitment to transform India…There has been no blot of corruption on me in the past 25 years as Chief Minister and Prime Minister. I don't own a home or even a bicycle... The corrupt JMM and the Congress leaders have amassed huge wealth for their children.” In Sisai, Lohardaga, Modi said the NDA government has “unmasked” corrupt forces and all those who indulged in corruption will face action under law in the next five years. Hitting out at jailed former Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren without taking his name, Modi said: ""The former Jharkhand CM is behind bars for corruption... Modi is committed to wipe out the menace of corruption. In the next five years, all those who indulged in corruption will face legal action,"" he said. “The INDI alliance leaders, neck-deep in corruption, hold rallies, including in Delhi and Ranchi, voicing support for corrupt people, which reveals their true character,” the PM said. Modi also blamed the Congress for the “backwardness” of tribal districts, alleging that food grains used to rot in godowns during the UPA regime from 2004 to 2014, while tribal children died due to starvation. Modi said the NDA government ensured that the poor got access to the internet unlike the Congress, which was “against” it. “Today's youths are the heroes of social media. The Congress had made the internet a thing for the rich, but Modi ensured it became available for the poor. We made mobile data affordable for all,"" he said. The PM also slammed the Congress for not taking any action against Maoists “to preserve the party's votebank”. He said: “But, as long as Modi is alive, no one will be allowed to put tribal lives at risk.” Modi also accused the Opposition parties of “trying to rob” SC, ST, OBC and tribals of reservations because of the “disillusionment” these deprived sections feel towards the INDIA bloc. “The INDI alliance is trying to divert reservations to Muslims. They are going against the views of Babasaheb Ambedkar and first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, neither of whom was in favour of reservations on religious lines,"" Modi claimed. He also slammed Tejashwi Yadav for bringing up the ""Hindu Muslim narrative"" at rallies while talking about the Agnipath scheme” and said, “When we talk about the martyrdom of Captain Hameed, do we think of him as a Muslim?” Without referring to Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav by their names, he said, ""There is a shehzada in Delhi and one in Patna, both of whom think of the country as their jaagir (fiefdom)."" He added: “Their mindset was exposed when they raised questions about the surgical strikes and spoke ill of the armed forces."" A large crowd cheered for the Prime Minister at the Kanpur roadshow in Uttar Pradesh. Mr Modi visited the Gumati Gurdwara before starting his roadshow in support of the BJP's candidates for the Kanpur and Akbarpur Lok Sabha seats.

On Monday, officials reported that Lufthansa flight LH752, en route from Frankfurt to Hyderabad, had to return to Germany following a bomb threat. In response, a threat assessment committee was convened in accordance with Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). Sources revealed that the Hyderabad-bound flight departed Frankfurt on June 15 and was scheduled to arrive early the following morning. However, at 6:01 PM IST on June 15, Hyderabad airport received an email warning of a potential bomb threat targeting the flight. Acting out of an abundance of caution, authorities advised the aircraft to turn back.

""A bomb threat assessment committee was activated, and all protocols were followed per SOP. For safety reasons, the airline was instructed to return to Frankfurt or divert to the nearest suitable airport,"" an official source stated.

Lufthansa later informed ANI that the flight was unable to secure landing clearance in Hyderabad, prompting the decision to return to its origin.

A Lufthansa spokesperson confirmed the diversion, citing safety concerns: ""Out of an abundance of caution, Lufthansa flight LH752 from Frankfurt to Hyderabad returned after authorities were alerted to a bomb threat posted on social media. Passenger and crew safety is Lufthansa’s highest priority."" The spokesperson added that affected passengers were accommodated in Frankfurt and would continue their journey to Hyderabad later. Hyderabad airport authorities noted that the flight had not yet entered Indian airspace when the threat was received, allowing for the diversion.

An investigation into the incident is currently ongoing.

This follows a similar case on June 13, when Air India flight AI 379 from Phuket to Delhi received a bomb threat mid-flight.

36ca6e3d6831ab88ce7effc018cd62e3,"[DOC 1] Chennai: Not yielding to political threats and bribery attempts, a
group of residents from Kottivakkam has managed to retrieve a
children's play area, at the end of a long legal battle. A public park
constructed on this premises was opened to the public without
much fanfare on Thursday last.
For more than four decades, public land, worth at least 6 crore
today (measuring four grounds; 1 ground = 2,400 sq ft), was put to
commercial use by a man named Sonny George. Since 1968, he
has refused to earmark two of the total 40 residential plots for
public purposes.
He had leased it out to a food processing centre which dealt with
chicken exports. “Since foul smell started to emanate from the spot and caused other serious health hazards, we
complained about it to the local authorities but no action was taken,” said professor D Ranganayakulu, president
of Vaidehi Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, who later filed a case in Madras high court in 2011.
State agencies told the court that George was at fault and directed him to execute a gift deed in favour of the
local authority conveying the open space to be used as a children's play area. However, George refused and
argued that it was an unapproved layout and there was no mandate on his part to retain any plots for public
purpose. Condemning this, the court ordered the govt in 2018 to remove all obstructions within two weeks. Six years down the line, the corporation has built a park on this piece of land. “We had to withstand a series of
threats and bribe attempts from various quarters to get the job done. Seeing children today playing at the park,
we feel it is worth the struggle,” said Ranganayakulu.","Residents of Kottivakkam in Chennai successfully reclaimed public land that had been misused for commercial purposes for over four decades. Despite facing political threats and bribery attempts, they persisted in their legal battle. The land, valued at around 6 crore rupees today, was leased out for a food processing center, causing health hazards. After a prolonged legal process, the Madras High Court directed the owner to hand over the land for a children's play area. Despite resistance, the park was finally constructed by the corporation, bringing an end to the residents' struggle.

Travelling across the US as the winter Olympics in Sochi commenced, one was saddened to witness how India’s international credibility had been shaken, when television audiences across the world saw three forlorn Indian athletes marching without a national flag. India faced this disgrace thanks to the avariciousness and nepotism of an internationally disgraced Indian Olympic Association. Sadly, this was accompanied by charges of corruption, nepotism, match fixing and worse involving the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Many Indian friends in the US asked in anguish: “Is there no section of national life left in India which is free from corruption and venalityIJ”

The mood in Washington, where one had occasion to meet a wide cross-section of senior officials, business executives, analysts and scholars, was quite different. In marked contrast to earlier years, I found widespread criticism of the conduct of foreign and security policies by President Barack Obama. The Administration had not only botched up its healthcare programme, but was seen as indecisive and weak in dealing with challenges in West Asia, Afghanistan and the provocations of a jingoistic and militaristic China. President Obama, in turn, is acutely conscious of the mood in the country, which wants an end to foreign military entanglements.

More significantly, as the US moves towards becoming a net exporter of energy, thanks to expanding production of shale gas and oil, the country’s geopolitics are set for profound changes. Using its leadership in areas of productivity and innovation, the US now appears set to the stage for increasing domination of the world economic order. From across its eastern shores, the US is negotiating a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership with its European allies. Across its western shores in the Pacific, the Americans are negotiating a Transpacific Partnership, with Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam as negotiating partners. While China has informally indicated an interest in joining this partnership, the US will use its influence to ensure that China is not admitted till American political and economic pre-conditions are met.

There is naturally interest in Washington in the forthcoming general election in India. The assessment appears to be that the ruling Congress is headed for a drubbing in the poll. Not many tears will be shed in Washington or elsewhere about this inevitability, as the only questions which well-wishers of India ask are how India landed itself in its present morass of corruption and whether a new dispensation, which may be fractious, will be able to restore India to a high growth path.  Speaking informally, a senior Administration official recalled that President Obama had described the US-India partnership as “one of the defining partnerships of the world”. The official noted that “every meaningful partnership between powerful nations encounters setbacks”, adding that such setbacks should be minor compared to the benefits of the relationship and the magnitude of what the two could accomplish together.

The Khobragade episode was a defining event in India-US relations. The Americans found Indians across the political spectrum united in the view that insults to India’s national dignity would not be acceptable. It is important that in future negotiations by the task force set up to address such issues, India should make it clear that it will not tolerate events like Ms Sonia Gandhi being threatened with prosecution while undergoing medical treatment in New York, or the supercilious attitude adopted towards Mr Narendra Modi, who is a constitutionally-elected Chief Minister. We should not accept a situation where Americans believe that they can behave high-handedly towards our elected politicians because of their domestic lobbies. The US should also be left in no doubt that on such issues, including consular and diplomatic privileges, India will firmly adhere to a policy of strict reciprocity.

The Obama Administration has messed up its relations with Mr Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan, dealing with him in a manner that showed scant regard for his position as the elected head of state of Afghanistan. Worse still, by its actions, the US has clearly given the impression that despite its protestations it was clandestinely dealing, behind Mr Karzai’s back, with the Taliban. While the US-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership speaks of joint determination in eliminating the ‘Al Qaeda and its affiliates’, the US now speaks only of eliminating the Al Qaeda and not is affiliates like the Taliban, the Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, the lashkar-e-Tayyeba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed. There are naturally concerns in Afghanistan that the US, which needs Pakistan’s assistance for withdrawing its military equipment from Afghanistan, will seek to appease them by giving them a less than healthy role in determining the future dispensation in Afghanistan and the role of the Taliban in such a dispensation.

While there is an evident congruence of interests in working with the US, Japan and others in the face of growing Chinese military assertiveness, New Delhi and Tokyo cannot ignore the reality that there have been many flip flops and inconsistencies in the approach of the Obama Administration to China. Moreover, the US is becoming increasingly strident in its economic relations with India on issues ranging from sanctions on sections of our Pharmaceutical industry and our Civil Aviation facilities, while demanding changes in our policies on solar panels and equipment and placing restrictions on the movement of IT personnel. It is, however, not India alone that is the recipient of such measures from the US!

Despite these challenges, India cannot ignore the reality that the US is the pre-eminent power in world. Moreover, it will remain so in coming years, primarily because its innovative and technological strengths are going to be reinforced by its energy surpluses, together with the energy potential of its neighbours like Canada, Mexico and Argentina. It will, moreover, remain the foremost power in the manufacture of high-tech equipment, particularly in defence and aerospace. It is for India to fashion industrial policies to leverage its strengths and potential to secure high levels of investment and partnership in crucial high-tech industries. I was advised in Washington that contracts currently secured with US companies enable us to import 5.8 million metric tonnes per annum of shale gas from the US annually from 1917. According to oil industry sources these contracts alone provides us more gas than we could obtain from the controversial Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline. But, for all this to fructify, the new dispensation in New Delhi will have to replace economic populism and accompanying fiscal irresponsibility, with a quest for accelerated growth.","The article discusses the strained relations between India and the United States, highlighting instances of disrespect towards Indian officials and athletes. It criticizes the Obama administration's foreign policy decisions and emphasizes the need for India to assert itself on the global stage while navigating economic and geopolitical challenges, particularly in relation to China and energy partnerships with the U.S. It calls for a shift towards growth-oriented policies to enhance India's position in high-tech industries."

  ""Har cheez mein PM ko target karne ka matlab hamari samajh mein nahin aa raha hai (I do not understand why this targeting of the Prime Minister on every issue). I am responsible for internal security. They should target me. Prime Minister is an institution… attacking (PM) does not benefit the country,"" he told ETin an exclusive interview.
  Calling for a dialogue to cool down tempers amid growing criticism of the government, Singh said: ""I am ready to discuss everything. I am ready to set aside everything else and sit down a whole day with them. I will welcome them to come and highlight the reasons they feel have given rise to intolerance.""
  When asked if this can be considered as an official invitation for dialogue, the home minister said: ""Yes. Yes. Main taiyar hun. Unse charcha ko main bilkul taiyar hun. Main swagat karunga charcha ki. (I am ready for a discussion with them. I will welcome a discussion with them). They should explain their concerns. And not only that, if they really highlight some concerns, I will welcome their valuable suggestions.""
  While emphasising on ""samvaad"" (dialogue), Singh did wonder aloud like other BJP leaders as to why awards were not returned when bigger communal riots took place under different governments.
  ""Uss samay toh award wapsi ki baatien toh hui nahin (no award returning happened in those times). Lekin phir bhi, yadi unka yah mat hai, toh democracy mein main chahunga ki unke saath charcha honi chahiye (Still, if they feel like that we should have a discussion in democracy),"" Singh told ET.
  The home minister went a step ahead and assured there would be no curb on people’s food or religious preferences under his watch. ""(I want to say) There is no restriction on people’s eating habits. There is no restriction on one’s religious practices.""
  On BJP president Amit Shah’s remark that crackers will be burst in Pakistan if the Mahagathbandhan were to win the 
  elections, Singh said it might just have been an expression of frustration with Pakistan and should not be over-interpreted. ""It should not be interpreted wrongly… we are trying to improve our relations with our neighbour, but Pakistan is not responding the way we expect. Uske kaaran jo mann mein dard hoga uski abhivyakti hai (It is an expression of the hurt over that issue). Yehi tatparya raha hoga (this would have been his intention).
  Singh strongly refuted suggestions that the BJP was trying to communalise the election pitch through such statements, parking the blame on the Grand Alliance leadership for bringing down the standard of campaign language.
  ""I do not have any barometer … but leaders of Grand Alliance must be careful that the decorum is not breached. The level of discourse should not go down."" When asked about BJP leaders crossing the line, Singh quipped: ""This suggestion is for everyone…. but our party trains us to maintain a decorum.""
  The home minister refused to get drawn into any detailed comment on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh but strongly defended any accusation that the Sangh was communal in outlook.
  ""I am a follower of RSS’ ideology….if that ideology was communal or believed in discrimination, it would be reflected in my behaviour.""
  He, however, refused to say much on RSS’ recent concerns on demographic imbalance on the basis of latest census data, a subject that comes under the home ministry.
  ""No body had called me. I cannot comment about RSS’ internal meeting. I am not part of those deliberations.""","Alliance leadership for bringing down the standard of campaign language.

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, which was launched fully on Thursday, is possibly the most important step that India has taken towards achieving sovereign strategic autonomy in many years. Once operational, this indigenous system will significantly reduce India’s dependence on satellite navigation systems (commonly known as SatNav systems) that are run by other countries — primarily the US and its Global Positioning System. America's GPS currently supports India's existing SatNav system, Gagan (GPS-Aided GEO Augmented Navigation). Gagan mostly caters to space scientists and the commercial aviation industry but IRNSS will have a wider user-base and, importantly, will function independently; though, of course, it will still be compatible with the GPS as well as with Russia's Global Navigation Satellite System (known as Glonass). The purpose of a SatNav system is to accurately track the location or positioning of an object. This object can be anything — a vehicle, an individual, a delivery package, a mobile phone or even a bird or an animal fitted with a receiver and transmitter. Today, SatNav systems are integral to a wide variety of activities. Some of them are as basic as the use of the Google Maps application on our phones and some much more complex such as the technology used to navigate our mass transit systems, be they under-ground, on land, over water or in the air. SatNav systems also play an important role in emergency services, disaster management and help with weather forecasting; they are used for geological surveys and mapping activities, in archaeological studies as well as for photographic geo-coding. Increasingly, SatNav systems are also being used for social networking. This list can go on but it should suffice to say that SatNav systems underline just about every activity in our daily lives and, given that this trend will only grow stronger in the days to come, it is the fitness of things that India has developed its own SatNav system.","India has successfully launched its fully operational Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), reducing the country's reliance on other countries' satellite navigation systems. IRNSS, known as NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), aims to provide accurate position information to users in India and the surrounding region. This move enhances India's strategic autonomy and reduces dependence on systems like the US Global Positioning System (GPS). IRNSS is compatible with GPS and Russia's Glonass, providing a wide range of applications from navigation to disaster management and weather forecasting."

98f3331f8f0799333eb9fe1935dad483,"[DOC 1] In a veiled reference to recent developments in Jharkhand, President APJ Abdul Kalam today decried dubious and undemocratic means adopted to cobble up numbers to form governments and called for introspection so that politics did not degrade itself to political adventurism.

Making candid observations over polling processes that have been, of late, under severe strain with fatal violence, the President pleaded with the parliamentarians to embark upon course of “developmental politics” instead of “political politics” which the political parties had been following now.

“The arithmetical compulsions of incremental numbers and the alleged tradability of certain legislative seats, won perhaps through means allegedly dubious and undemocratic, have many a time created doubts on our democratic system in the public eye”, Dr Kalam said.

The President was speaking in the Central Hall of Parliament after giving away the Outstanding Parliamentarian Awards to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Union Minister Arjun Singh, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha L K Advani and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Jaswant Singh.

Dr Kalam said when politics degraded itself to political adventurism; the nation would be on the calamitous road to inevitable disaster and ruination.

He said, “Let us not risk it. It is time all of us did introspection and grew up to the expectations that were enshrined so diligently and optimistically by the founding fathers in our Constitution so that India sustained itself and grew as a mature, healthy, vibrant democratic nation.”

Accepting the award, the Prime Minister regretted the decline in general atmosphere in Parliament and standard of debate and called for introspection before people lose faith in the institution.

Reminding the gathering that people were yearning for lifestyle change and expect Parliamentarians to bring smile on their faces through appropriate policies, laws and facilitating societal transition, the President said, “We seem to have been working with policies and procedures which are at times based on mistrust.”

Seeking to distinguish between ‘political politics’ and ‘developmental politics’, he said the former was needed at the time of independence movement.

Today, the President said, what was needed for India was a mission to make it free from poverty, illiteracy and unemployment and this situation necessitated developmental politics.

Dr Kalam said Parliament needed to launch a mission to identify and scrap complex old laws and those administrative procedures, which hindered growth-oriented development economy.

“This will give scope and a hope to a large section of the people who are honest, to flower and flourish. India must move to a trust-based system and only members of this great Parliament can bring about this change,” the President said.

Presenting a situation in which political parties perform in the environment of developmental politics competing with each other, the President said while one party would promise to make India a developed nation with a growth plan of every five years in 15 years, another would unveil a new strategy to achieve it in a shorter period.

In another scenario, he expected parties to ensure all border conflicts were resolved in 10 years while another would promise to create harmonious relationship within a period of five years. Yet another might say, border trade would become meaningless.

Dr Singh said everyone would agree that the increasingly negative public perception of politics as an instrument of social change and those who make it their vocation was partly due to decline in standards.

“Without pointing fingers, we need to examine whether we are living up to the standards set by great parliamentarians of early years of our independence. It is for us to ensure that we set better standards for future,” the Prime Minister said.

Dr Singh said the day the people begin to lose faith in the institution of Parliament would also be the day that this important edifice would come under pressure. “We must not; we must never let this happen.” ","President APJ Abdul Kalam expressed concern over recent developments in Jharkhand and criticized dubious and undemocratic means used to form governments. In a speech at the Central Hall of Parliament, he called for introspection to prevent politics from degrading itself to political adventurism.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, receiving the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award, regretted the decline in the atmosphere in Parliament and called for introspection to restore public faith in the institution."

MRLs are primarily trading standards, but they also help ensure that residue levels do not pose unacceptable risks for consumers.
Recently, the Tea Board had said the export target needs to be raised by 50 per cent by tapping new countries and filling up the vacuum created by crisis-hit Sri Lanka in the global market.
India exported 195.90 million kg of tea in 2021. The major buyers were the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS) nations, such as Russia, and Iran.
The board is aiming at achieving 300 million kg of tea this year.
""Return of Indian export consignments is hardly any"", P K Bezboruah, former Tea Board chairman said.
A senior official of the Tea Board told PTI that complaints have been received from tea packagers and exporters on the issue.
""It is reiterated that producers should strictly abide by the extant norms of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The issue of modification of the norms has been raised by the producer organisations with FSSAI. It is obvious that exports should adhere to the existing norms of the importing countries,"" the official said.

f4b347b16bd6584ce89c54ad3fe0eb9e,"[DOC 1] By Shalini JainSenior Manager, Tax & Regulatory Services, Ernst & YoungSavings or investments are important for any economy, since, high levels of savings help the economy progress on a continuous growth path. The investments are mainly financed out of savings of masses. Given the importance of savings, the Government from time-to-time provides various incentives for promoting the domestic household savings. In India, the saving behavior of the people is largely motivated by the tax incentives or benefits attached to any saving instrument. Any instrument of saving/investment scheme has three stages of life, which are (a) Investment stage (b) Accumulation or Earning stage and (c) Withdrawal stage. The Government provides tax incentives or benefits at any or each stage of the saving instrument, depending upon its policy. Pre-Budget: Tax CalculatorPost-Budget: Tax CalculatorAt the investment stage, the tax benefits are provided by giving deduction of the amount saved or invested from the total taxable income of the individual. For example, the amount invested in Public Provident Fund (PPF) account is eligible for deduction from the total taxable income of an individual, subject to certain limits. At the earning stage, the benefits are provided by tax exempting the income earned on the savings or investment. For example, interest earned or accrued to the credit of PPF balance amount is exempt from tax. At the withdrawal stage, the benefits are provided by not taxing the accumulated amount of principal, interest earned and bonus, if any, at the time of maturity or withdrawal of the saving instrument or investment. For example, the amount withdrawn from PPF account on maturity is not taxable. Therefore, PPF is out of the tax net throughout its life cycle viz. investment, earning and withdrawal and is exempt-exempt-exempt (popularly known as EEE) at each stage. It is pertinent to note here that the Government may, according to its tax policy, tax any instrument of investment or saving at any stage i.e. either at investment, earning or at withdrawal stage. If any savings instrument is taxed at the withdrawal stage, it falls under the EET (i.e. Exempt- Exempt- Tax) scheme of taxation. In other words, under the EET regime, saving instruments are taxed neither at investment stage nor at earning stage but are taxed at the withdrawal stage. Therefore, every instrument of savings can be classified under permutation-combinations of EEE, EET, ETE, TEE, TTE or ETT according to the stage of taxability. Going forward, the Government is planning to rationalise the domestic savings environment by introducing the tax provisions for specified savings instruments, which are currently under EEE regime and hence, is proposing to tax the savings instruments at least at one stage, i.e. either at earning stage or at withdrawal stage. As discussed above, the tax policy of the country hugely affects the saving decision of the people. The transition of savings instruments from EEE regime to EET regime would have a significant impact on the saving behavior of population at large. It would change the investment choice and preference amongst the taxpayers. Under EET regime, the amount invested including interest, dividend, bonus, capital appreciation or any other form of return by whatever name called will be subject to tax at the time of actual receipt. The amount of withdrawal from long-term savings instruments likes Employee Provident Fund (EPF), PPF, Government Provident Fund (GPF) and so on which are currently out of tax net, will become taxable. The major impact of shift in taxation from EEE regime to EET regime will be on long term investment planning of the individual. From social security point of view, this will result in huge financial hit on the funds of the retiring population of the country who have invested their fortune in long term investment funds under EEE regime. Considering the savings and investments environment of the country, it would be better, if the new regime of EET is introduced for new investments and savings made on or after the introduction of new EET regime. This would also enable the institutions in prescribing the new regime in more efficient manner. If the existing savings and investments instruments are taxed prospectively from the day EET taxation is introduced, there may be difficulty in distinguishing the investment and accumulations under EEE regime and EET regime, in allocation of incomes accruing in respect of old contributions/accumulations and fresh investments/deposits, the manner of treating the withdrawals viz. whether on FIFO or LIFO basis to be adopted for identifying the withdrawals made out of investments/deposits. Therefore, there is a need for due caution to be exercised, while deciding the modalities of introducing the EET regime of taxation, so that the financial well being of the investors of this country is maintained. (Views expressed are personal)Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy","The government is planning to change the tax policy for savings instruments from EEE (exempt-exempt-exempt) to EET (exempt-exempt-tax). This will have a significant impact on the saving behavior of the population and the financial well-being of investors.

1424e1363a55e5293d2bdbff193f5607,"[DOC 1] Stereotyping & objectification of women in the media narrative is a universal truth, that need to be addressed, questioned & reversed, writes Jaishri Jethwaney in her new book. An edited excerpt:

The 1970s saw the rise of trade unionism and advocacy movements for civil liberties, especially after the clamping of emergency by Mrs. Indira Gandhi in 1975. Further, in 1974 a document was prepared on the Status of Women by the official Status of Women Commission, titled ‘Towards Equality.’ It focused attention on the fact that, despite many progressive social legislations and constitutional guarantees, women’s status in India had indeed not improved much, especially in many areas like political, economic and social spheres. This document has been the basis for many legislations and development programs focusing on gender as well as creation of women’s organizations and working groups — as discussed later. The United Nations declared 1975 as the International Year for women and 8 March as the International Day for Women.

The last 70+ years of independence has seen many organizations springing up that have espoused the cause of women, both in the cities and at grassroots level. Domestic violence, alcoholism, female feticide, sexual harassment of women at work place, skewed and unjust family laws, reproductive rights, legislative reforms are some of the issues spearheaded by civil society organizations and NGOs. On the academic front, many universities in the 1970s set up Women Studies’ centres.

A pioneer in Women’s studies, Dr. Vina Mazumdar was the first one in the independent India to combine activism with scholarly research in women’s studies.

Vina Mazumdar [1994] argues that women became a point of engagement in politics as well as research and academia during the colonial rule with an objective to justify both social reform or to give a backbone for India’s cultural pride. She writes that this however, became redundant in post-independent India, as the need for justification was no longer necessary. This may have in some way led to the side-lining of women’s issue and with that the increase in gender disparity between men and women. This gap was highlighted in the investigation by the Committee on the Status of Women in India and the subsequent report ‘Towards Equality’ 1975. With this, a new agenda was set to change the status of women and for that research on women’s issue was one area, which received the impetus. A new program for Women’s Studies, initiated by the ICSSR began which, over the years has seen a lot of seminal work in this arena. This went along with several other processes of bringing about change and empowerment as the larger women’s movement also went along. Critics however, feel that in the beginning, there was a lot of academia — civil society interface, which over the years, has eroded.

Many UN organizations like the UNICEF, UNFPO and UNESCO have also entered the policy dialogue with the government based on milestones articulated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) of which India is a signatory.

Equal Rights and Opportunities Guaranteed by Constitution of India

The Constitution of India provides equal status and opportunities to women along with men. The Indian women received equal political rights for which their western counterparts had to fight a long battle.

Women-Centric Laws

Since the country’s independence in 1947, many laws have been passed to address the issues of equal opportunities for women at work place and home to address issues of sexual harassment at work place, domestic violence, dowry, and female infanticide, and feticide, property rights among others. Discrimination, however, is so well entrenched in the patriarchal mind-set of the society coupled with ignorance and centuries of subjugation that both the urban and the rural women endure (particularly the latter as they suffer in larger measure in every possible way) when it comes to equality. Women, especially in the rural arena are raped and wronged to settle caste rivalries. Young women choosing to wed out of caste and religion often become victims of honour killing. Who they can marry, what they would wear, how they would behave are sometime issues discussed in the illegal Khap panchayats, while the state administration is often seen as a mute spectator.

The passing of the two acts viz. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prohibition), 2013, and the Indecent Portrayal of Women in Media (Prohibition), 1986, together with many other acts including against those against domestic violence, dowry, and sex determination as well as the setting up of the National Commission for Women (NCW) at the centre and other state level commissions are pointers to the efforts by myriad women rights organizations in influencing policy and also various governments in addressing women issues.

Having said that, there is no gain saying that there are laws in place but it is the implementation, which is more often lax. Social transformation accompanied with implementation of laws shall be the key to address women related issues in India. The feminist literature and movements bear testimony to the fact that feminism is very much home grown and organic in India and not a copy of the West as generally alleged. The feminist movement is not against men but about fighting the power structures that are so well embedded in the familial, social, political and economic spheres.","The article discusses the stereotyping and objectification of women in the media narrative, highlighting the need to address, question, and reverse these trends. The author, Jaishri Jethwaney, notes that the 1970s saw the rise of trade unionism and advocacy movements for civil liberties, including the Status of Women Commission's report ""Towards Equality"" in 1975. This document highlighted the lack of improvement in women's status in India despite progressive social legislations and constitutional guarantees.
The article also discusses the growth of women's studies centers in universities and the work of pioneers like Dr. Vina Mazumdar, who combined activism with scholarly research. The author argues that the need to justify women's issues in colonial India led to their sidelining in post-independent India, resulting in increased gender disparity.
The article highlights the importance of equal rights and opportunities guaranteed by the Constitution of India and the various laws passed to address women's issues, such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, and property rights. However, it also notes that discrimination and ignorance are deeply entrenched in the patriarchal mindset, leading to continued subjugation of women, particularly in rural areas.
The author concludes that social transformation accompanied by the implementation of laws is key to addressing women-related issues in India. The feminist movement is not against men but about fighting power structures embedded in familial, social, political, and economic spheres."

Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, traditionally London-based, have a personal fortune estimated at £6 billion. Like their brothers Prakash and Ashok, they are the descendants of Parmanand Hinduja who created the family fortune by founding an astute trading business between India and Iran.

Although surrounded by a tightly knit group of loyal friends, Srichand and Gopichand have in recent years kept a low profile, ever since it was revealed in 2001 that former Labour minister Peter Mandelson had contacted the Home Office to inquire about one of the brother's application for British citizenship.

The British media's focus on their lives intensified after it subsequently turned out that another Labour minister, Keith Vaz, had made even more energetic inquiries about their passport applications. Questions were also raised about why the Hinduja Foundation had made payments to a company run by Vaz's wife.

Elizabeth Filkin, the UK's Parliamentary commissioner for Standards at the time, conceded that the money had been given for legal advice on immigration issues and that Vaz himself had gained no direct financial benefit, but she was critical of the secrecy surrounding the Vaz-Hinduja connection. She said at the time: ""It is clear to me there has been deliberate collusion over many months between Vaz and his wife to conceal this fact and to prevent me from obtaining accurate information about his possible financial relationship with the Hinduja family"".

These and other related issues now seem to belong to another age as the Hinduja brothers prepare to move into their four renovated properties on Carlton House Terrace, designed by John Nash and commissioned by King George IV in 1820, where they will be neighbours of the British Foreign Secretary and the Foreign Press Club.

Their new London residence is the Delhi equivalent of moving into a refurbished property on Tughlaq Road or Aurangzeb Road. They are said to have paid some £60 million for the property, which is more than what Lakshmi Mittal, Britain's richest man and also an Indian, paid for his home in Kensington Palace Gardens in another part of London.

At their new home, the Hindujas will be a stone's throw from Trafalgar Square and a short walk from Buckingham Palace. A swimming pool and private cinema are part of the palatial new home which is made up of some 50 rooms over six floors.

But there are other luxurious touches as well, including marble floors, gold leaf and elephant motifs, which prompted a director of English Heritage to comment: ""I can't think of another domestic restoration project on this scale with buildings of this importance. Rarely have we seen such opulence allied to such craftsmanship and design."" ","Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, wealthy London-based brothers with a fortune estimated at £6 billion, are set to re-enter British high society with the completion of their £100 million home in central London.

Now residing in John Nash-designed properties on Carlton House Terrace, near prominent London landmarks, their new residence boasts luxurious features like marble floors, gold leaf accents, and a private cinema. This restoration project is noted for its opulence and craftsmanship, marking their return to a prestigious neighborhood alongside notable figures like the British Foreign Secretary."

""The issue raised by (AIADMK leader) V Maitreyan is indeed very serious. India strongly condemns it. We will definitely summon the High Commissioner of that country and tell him about it,"" External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said in the Rajya Sabha after AIADMK members trooped into the Well demanding a statement from the government.

Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha witnessed two adjournments each as AIADMK members disrupted the proceedings and stormed the Well seeking a statement from the government and raising slogans denouncing the Sri Lankan President.

In the Lower House, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said, ""While matters concerning diplomatic relations are dealt with delicately, this is totally unacceptable and condemnable. There is no hesitation in condemning it.""

He also said he would convey the ""strong feelings"" of the members to Swaraj. But the AIADMK members were not satisfied with the reply and stormed the Well raising slogans like 'Rajapakse down, down' and 'We want justice'.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Rajya Sabha, Maitreyan said the article, which had an objectionable headline and illustration, appearing in the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry website was ""derogatory"" to Jayalalithaa. He asked whether the government would summon the Sri Lankan High Commissioner as this was ""an insult"" of not only the Tamil Nadu Government but also the Union Government.

Jayalalithaa had earlier said the visual rendering on the homepage of the official website just above the link is highly objectionable as it depicted both the Prime Minister of India and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in a very trivialised, derogatory and disrespectful manner.

5378252f714a052d538ff40afee01472,"[DOC 1] An Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of the elite Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police was killed and three others were injured in a gun battle at Sopore town in north Kashmir on Tuesday morning. The militants managed to break the security cordon after the encounter.

Militant outfit Hizbul Mujahideen claimed responsibility and said that its cadres carried out the ambush. Balig-ud-Din, operational spokesman of Hizb, told a local news agency, “Our boys reached back safely,” he said.

The encounter in Sopore, 50 km from here, is the first shootout between militants and security forces this year. Security and political analysts in the region fear that 2014 may be turbulent for J&K as NATO forces are scheduled to leave Afghanistan later this year.

Sources said the SOG team, on an intelligence tip-off about the presence of two militants, including a local Lashker-e-Toiba commander Muzaffar Naikoo alias Muza Molivi, in a house in the dense locality of Chanakan, started sealing the area. On seeing them, militants opened fire on the SOG personnel who were in civvies.

“As the area was being sealed, militants opened fire and hurled a grenade on the party in which four SOG men including ASI Kafeel Ahmed were injured,” said a police officer.

“Ahmed received bullet and splinter wounds in his abdomen and was shifted to a Srinagar hospital where he succumbed to his injures,” he added.

Reinforcements from the Army and CRPF were immediately rushed to the area to tighten the cordon and prevent the militants’ escape. The security forces carried out searches in the area but they could not trace the militants. Sources, however, said that the militants managed to break the cordon after the initial gunfight. The search operation was later called off.

The police said that ASI Ahmed, a resident of the frontier Kupwara district, had been posted in Sopore for the past six years and had received injures at least twice during various encounters. Ahmed is survived by two minor children, wife and an aged mother. Inspector General Police, Kashmir, AG Mir said that the search operation was launched after they received an input about the presence of militants.

“We had an input about the presence of militants and after which a search operation was launched. The militants hurdled grenades and opened fire in which four of our men were injured. One of them achieved martyrdom,” he said.","An Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police's Special Operations Group (SOG) was killed, and three others were injured in a gun battle with militants in Sopore. The Hizbul Mujahideen claimed responsibility, stating their members safely escaped. The encounter began after the SOG team, following an intelligence tip, attempted to seal the area where militants, including a Lashkar-e-Toiba commander, were believed to be hiding. The militants fired and threw grenades, injuring the SOG personnel. Reinforcements from the Army and CRPF were deployed, but the militants managed to escape. ASI Kafeel Ahmed, a veteran of multiple encounters, succumbed to his injuries."

3040e9c5f8d166a45c2af96a5ca6f6a1,"[DOC 1] The aberration that Lionel Messi will end a career without a World Cup will now stay in the realm of fiction. A 36-year-wait ended for Argentina on Sunday night in the most thrilling of finals. And as he walked in front of his team mates in regal robes, kissing the trophy and holding it aloft, no longer would Messi be a step behind Diego Maradona. Doha had brought them level after a tournament where, watched by the world and facing intense pressure, Messi was as inspirational as Maradona was in 1986.

But it wasn’t easy, just as it hadn’t been for Maradona in that 1986 final when Germany had drawn level from 2-0 down.

On Sunday, 2-0 to 2-2 in 97 seconds meant Argentina, who were sauntering to their third World Cup title — and the first since that magical night at Mexico ‘86 — had to do it all over again. So they did through who else but Lionel Messi. When Kylian Mbappe shot France back in contention with that two-goal burst, Messi had to respond. And when he scored again, deep into extra time to seal it for a second time, Mbappe hit back by becoming the first player since Geoff Hurst in 1966 to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final.

In the tie-breaker — in which both Messi and Mbappe scored — the hand of Emiliano Martinez gave Argentina the title for what seemed like the third time in one night.

Cue hugs. Cue song. Cue chants. Cue tears. And Cue Sergio Aguero flying down the stands to envelop Messi. Having cried after scoring and again when France drew level, Angel di Maria, whose goal had fetched Argentina the Copa America in 2021, could now weep in joy.

Sunday seemed a slow day, the build-up to the final usually is. 63 of the games were done and everybody needed to catch their breath before the big one. As it is, the World Cup has throbbed only in parts of Doha, never the whole. All day, areas near the Qatar National Library, the residential blocks in Al Sadd and even the main media centre, usually buzzing with thousands of journalists, looked like it was sleeping in late on a Sunday. Which being Qatar’s National Day, was a holiday.

It changed as you got nearer to the Lusail. By early evening, all roads leading to it were clogged, a coach ferrying media to the stadium got lost and suddenly things began to get hectic. The Lusail, lit and golden, was like a giant beehive to which everyone flocked. In Argentina shirts, in those of France and some waving flags of Qatar too.

The closing ceremony was a “mashup”, in FIFA’s words, of songs we heard through the past 29 days. It was called “A Night To Remember,” but was really a prelude to an unforgettable night.

Everything, from Deepika Padukone and Iker Casillas accompanying the 6.175kg trophy that travels in a designer bag to Messi’s brief hug with Antoine Griezmann, the warm-ups and the lung-bursting rendition of national anthems were that: a prelude to a memorable night.

It was difficult to say who among Messi or Mbappe got the louder cheer when the teams were being announced but there was no doubting that in the 23rd minute.

That was when Martinez could again look at the game after kissing a post and when Lautaro Martinez would fist his appreciation into the substitute’s bench.

That was also when Messi had converted the penalty kick with a placement that sent Hugo Lloris the wrong way. The roar that followed, as Messi found himself at the bottom of a players’ pile, would have reached the moon.

One section of the Lusail bounced like it was on a trampoline. It was the same section, behind Martinez’s goal, that was roaring “Argentina, Argentina” when Di Maria made it 2-0 ending a sweeping move that had Argentina swiftly moving the ball from the right edge of their penalty area to the left edge of France’s. The defending champions, usually so clinical in their approach to games, were being bossed.

Till Didier Deschamps decided to make first-half substitutions getting in Marcus Thuram and Randal Kolo Muani. Like most of Doha, France woke up late but their stirring comeback produced a final for the ages.

Neither deserved to lose, neither did in open play. Say your thank yous in whatever language you want, these two sets of gladiators deserve nothing but our appreciation.","Argentina defeated France in a thrilling World Cup final. Messi scored twice, and Mbappe scored a hat-trick. The match went to extra time and then a penalty shootout, which Argentina won. Argentina's win ends their 36-year wait for a World Cup title and gives Messi his first World Cup trophy."

Particulate pollutants in the air also mingled with the fog to form a sheet of smog that tinted the entire city for large parts of the day, pinching the visibility to 200m and hampering flight schedules once again.

Delhi clocked a 24-hour average AQI of 409 at 4pm, significantly worse than 368 (very poor) a day ago and 333 on Monday.

Still, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) resisted imposing curbs under Stage 3 of the Graded Response Action Plan.

The pollution spike came despite a jump in temperatures. Delhi’s minimum rose from 6.9°C on Tuesday to 8.3°C on Wednesday – a degree above normal. ","On Wednesday, pollution levels in **Delhi** escalated into the ""severe"" category, with the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** reaching **409**, up from **368** the previous day.

Despite a slight increase in night temperatures, from **6.9°C** to **8.3°C**, the **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)** opted against imposing stricter measures under Stage 3 of the **Graded Response Action Plan**. Experts warn that the pollution spike is likely to persist due to unfavorable meteorological conditions and ongoing local emissions."
d391993add37691456065da934300c1b,"[DOC 1] Scientists have found that the years 2001 to 2011 were the warmest in the last thousand years at high elevations of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The scientists also found that the region was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than during the 20th century. The team of scientists led by the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Germany, reconstructed the temperature from a set of ice cores, unprecedented in length and quality, of the past 1,000 years, which revealed that today’s warming in central-north Greenland is surprisingly pronounced. They also measured the melt production rate of the ice sheet, the study said. The Greenland Ice Sheet plays a pivotal part in the global climate system. With enormous amounts of water stored in the ice, about 3 million cubic kilometres, melt and resulting sea-level rise is considered a potential tipping point. For unmitigated global emissions rates, or ‘business as usual’ scenario, the ice sheet is projected to contribute up to 50 centimetres to global mean sea level by 2100, the study published in the journal Nature said. Weather stations along the coast have been recording rising temperatures for many years. In a study now published in the journal Nature, experts from the institute present clear evidence that the effects of global warming have reached the remote, high-elevation areas of central-north Greenland. “The time series we recovered from ice cores now continuously covers more than 1,000 years, from the year 1000 to 2011. This data shows that the warming from 2001 to 2011 clearly differs from natural variations during the past 1,000 years. Although grimly expected in the light of global warming, we were surprised by how evident this difference really was,” said AWI glaciologist Maria Hörhold, lead author of the study. Together with colleagues from AWI and the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, she analysed the isotope composition in shallow ice cores gathered in central-north Greenland during dedicated AWI expeditions, the study said. Previous ice cores obtained at co-located sites starting in the 1990s did not indicate clear warming in central-north Greenland, despite rising global mean temperatures. Part of the reason is substantial natural climate variability in the region, the study said.","A study led by the Alfred Wegener Institute found that the years 2001 to 2011 were the warmest in the last thousand years at high elevations of the Greenland Ice Sheet, with the region being 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than during the 20th century.

Elon Musk's company, xAI, has provided more insight into an upcoming feature for its AI-powered chatbot, Grok, known as ""Unhinged Mode."" The feature, teased last April, is expected to deliver responses that could be deemed objectionable or offensive, as outlined on an updated FAQ page on xAI's website. The mode will be designed to generate content that is similar to an amateur stand-up comedian still finding its voice, according to reports.

The introduction of Unhinged Mode may align with Musk's original vision for Grok. When the chatbot was introduced two years ago, Musk described it as edgy, unfiltered, and willing to answer controversial questions that other AI systems avoid. While Grok has met some of those expectations by producing vulgar content when prompted, it still maintains certain limits. On political subjects, Grok's responses have leaned left, particularly on issues like transgender rights and diversity, according to a [report](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/grok-may-soon-get-an-unhinged-mode/) by Tech Crunch.

08a1879a5e5c94919580f48fb48c5d8b,"[DOC 1] Q3 earnings share: We're now getting some strong numbers for the Q3 quarter. We saw a strong quarter driven by revenues growth for the major mobile products segment, from $1.9 billion to $1.9 billion in the quarter. The growth in the mobile-phone segment was strong. Sales of the desktop segment grew at more than 2 percent, along with the PC segment due to a number of strong business segments. The desktop segment will stay strong as well and will increase in quality in the mobile-business segment.

In Q1, we saw some strong growth in revenue and revenues for third quarter 2015, compared with the same times last year. In Q2, we saw higher revenues and the same year-over-year sales growth for the mobile-telephone segment as we saw in Q1, we believe a combination of business moves and a lot of performance enhancements will help us to maintain our Q2 revenue and revenues. We are pleased around the Q2 quarter as the revenues from third quarter 2015 was much higher than in Q1.

The main driver driving Q2 is the strong growth in our mobile-phone business from the quarter ended June 30, 2015, to the $1.3 billion we see in 2014. In our Q3 quarters, we have been able to capture a high proportion of our mobile-phone customers by adding to our mobile-device share as well. The Mobile-tablet segment added $4.8 billion of revenue to the revenue of the third quarter of 2015, and our smartphone-device share grew well in the quarter to $5.6 billion. The mobile-phone segment now sees a strong quarter driven by significant expansion of our mobile-phone business on both handsets. It continues to deliver revenue on the highest-margin phones and includes the highest-margin tablets. If we add to our mobile-phone business at the same pace as the growth of our tablet business, we will see higher sales and further increase in our mobile-device share.

As our main drivers for growth are the growth in our tablet business in Japan, we expect that both sales growth and Q3 earnings are strong for the quarter. In Q3 quarters, we sold more tablet units in Japan than we ever did before. We did see a few high-end devices in the quarter, but we will now add additional devices in all parts of the country in Q3.

In Q2, we saw high sales of new devices in Japan. In this quarter, we saw better iPad sales with $1.1 billion in sales. On the other hand, we did see sales for the second quarter of 2016. We believe these changes will provide more value to our customers and, if we add more to our tablet and smartphone business, we may see an additional revenue share for Q3.

We are also working on an internal plan to add more technology to our network to increase our customers. In Q2, we will continue our partnership with Samsung on the world's largest tablet business. We believe that we're a great partner in the global smartphone business and that we are a great example of a technology company. To enhance our efforts in our business plan we are working with several partners, including Qualcomm and Alcatel-Lucent that are our key partners in the network hardware business.

Our mobile business is now performing quite well as shown at our Q2 earnings. This quarter we have introduced a new operating system and enhanced internal and external call center, with new software that has a potential to enhance our mobile-phone experience, and improvements to be made to our mobile-communications services. We continue to increase our user base at home and our mobile-mobile business is now seeing very strong growth. More phones are coming, and we will see more growth, particularly in the second half of the year, as the demand for smartphones for both the home and business environment improves and this brings more devices from the home.

Finally, I want to highlight that we have implemented a number of new initiatives with our Mobile Device portfolio. For example, we were able to deliver new mobile products on the iPad 3 (in Japan) to our more than 10 million customers. The company currently has 10 million mobile phones, and we are now ready to bring in the first generation of all the devices.

Overall, Q3 2016 saw a strong sales year of $1.7 billion in Q2. Sales of the second quarter of 2016 have been impressive, and I expect this to continue through Q3. On the other hand, that year was a lot of sales growth where we saw a lot of growth in tablets of a certain size or in devices with fewer buttons, especially in some markets where it was just under $3 billion.

What do you expect at our next GAAP release next week?","Q3 earnings share: We're now getting some strong numbers for the Q3 quarter.

MILAN: Giorgio Chiellini brought the curtain down on a trophy-packed career on Tuesday after the Italy icon announced his retirement from football.

Former Italy and Juventus defender Chiellini revealed he would be hanging up his boots at the age of 39 in a short post on social media accompanied by a video showing the highlights of his 23 years in the professional game.

""You have been the most beautiful and intense journey of my life. You have been my everything,"" Chiellini wrote.

""With you, I have travelled a unique and unforgettable path. But now it is time to start new chapters, face new challenges and write further important and exciting pages of life.""
Chiellini ended his career at Los Angeles FC in the Major Soccer League -- his final match Saturday's MLS Cup final defeat to Columbus Crew -- but he is best known for his exploits with Juventus and his country.

After joining Juve in 2005, Chiellini eventually became a cornerstone of the so-called ""BBC"" defence alongside Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci.

That defensive trio were key to propelling Juve back to domestic dominance after years in the doldrums following the 'Calciopoli' match-fixing scandal which exploded in the run-up to the 2006 World Cup.

Chiellini won nine consecutive Serie A titles between 2012 and 2020 and reached two Champions League finals with the Turin giants, who honoured him on social media with the message ""Warrior, captain, champion. Thanks for everything big Giorgio!""

Juve also posted a video depicting helicopters lifting a giant Juve jersey, emblazoned with 'Chiellini' and his squad number three, from the pitch at the club's Allianz Stadium.","Giorgio Chiellini, an Italy icon, announced his retirement from football at the age of 39.

On the eve of New Year 2014, Uttarakhand experienced light to moderate rains at isolated places in plains and snowfall in higher reaches. Areas in higher altitudes like Tapovan, Malari, Joshimath, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Kailash Mansarovar route, Auli, Nainital, Munsiyari and other polices received light to moderate snowfall.

The weather gods did not disappoint tourists thronging to the higher reaches of J&K and Himachal Pradesh with the hopes of ringing in a 'White New Year', but the heavy snowfall severely affected communications and traffic movement.

Kashmir was cut off from the rest of the country as heavy snowfall forced closure of several roads, including the arterial Srinagar-Jammu national highway, and led to the cancellation of all flights into and out of the city.

The snowfall brought about a jump in the mercury with Srinagar witnessing a nearly four degree rise in the minimum which settled at -1.4 degrees Celsius in the city, up from the -5.3 degrees recorded yesterday.

Although the weather in ladakh remained dry, the minimum there rose by several degrees with leh town seeing a low of -12.0 degrees, as against the -17.7 degrees recorded there the previous night.

The hills and valleys of Himachal Pradesh groaned under the biting cold amidst another spell of snowfall and widespread rain in the state.

Icy, strong velocity winds accompanied by rainfall and snow lashed Narkanda, Sarahan and other areas in the upper Shimla region with the Hindustan-Tibet National Highway blocked beyond Matiana as a result of fresh deposits.

Keylong and Kalpa in the lahaul and Spiti and Kinnaur districts, respectively, experienced moderate to heavy snowfall with the sky remaining largely overcast.

light to moderate rainfall also hit several places across Punjab and Haryana, leaving both states reeling under the chilly conditions.

Among the places which received rainfall were the Union Territory of Chandigarh, Amritsar, ludhiana, Pathankot, Phagwara, Jalandhar, Ambala, Panchkula, Sonepat and Karnal.

Narnaul in Haryana registered a low of 0.5 degrees while Hisar shivered at 1.5 degrees.

In Punjab, ludhiana and Amritsar saw the mercury settle at lows of 1.6 and 1.8 degrees, respectively. Western parts of Rajasthan continued to be in the grip of the intense cold with Jaisalmer recording the lowest minimum in the state at 1.7 degrees.","New Year's Eve in 2013 brought joy to the Kashmir Valley, Himachal Pradesh, and higher Uttarakhand regions with heavy snowfall, while northern India faced a persistent cold wave.

496273b91bc7af1f9bcbfabe9eb6ea30,"[DOC 1] West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya today regretted his statement on the Nandigram violence that villagers allegedly targeted by his CPM cadres were “paid back in their own coin.” He admitted he should not have said so.

Bhattacharya told mediapersons here that the violence in Nandigram was a “political and administrative” failure. He said, “We have learnt lessons from Nandigram that we have to take people into confidence... We have failed in Nandigram. It was an administrative and political failure.”

He affirmed that his priority was to bring back normalcy to the region in East Midnapore district where clashes between rival groups over land acquisition for industry since January left more than 35 persons dead.

Desiring peace for all, Bhattacharya, who is in the capital for the CPM politburo meeting, said that the situation in the troubled Nandigram blocks was “fast returning to normal” and most of those who had been evicted had already returned.

A total of Rs 1 crore had so far been spent by the Left Front government for their rehabilitation, including reconstruction and repair of damaged houses, roads, bridges as also supply of clothings, utensils and fertiliser mini-kits for the farmers to sow the rabi crop, he said.

The Chief Minister said a senior officer had been sent to the area to prepare a report on what kind of development projects could be implemented in the Nandigram area. “As soon as we get this report, I will announce the projects.”

He also claimed that the violence in Nandigram had not affected investments in the state. Bhattacharjee said, “Nandigram or no Nandigram, the process of industrialisation in West Bengal cannot be stopped.”

He said no corporate house, business group or foreign company had said they would withdraw from the state. “In fact, major foreign companies from Japan, the US, Singapore and Dubai have sent proposals” to invest in the state.

On the chemical hub, which was supposed to have come up at Nandigram, Bhattacharjee said it was now being set up at Nayachar, which did not have any habitation nor was the land arable.

About Bangladesh author Taslima Nasreen, who was shifted from Kolkata to Rajasthan and then to Delhi and subsequently to an undisclosed location following protests by a fundamentalist group last month, Bhattacharya said external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee would decide about the return of Taslima Nasreen to the Eastern metropolis.

Bhattacharjee also said he has no problem with the Governor, who earned the wrath of the top leadership of the ruling CPI-M for terming the manner of recapture of the Nandigram villages as “unlawful and unacceptable.”

“He is a nice man...I have good relations with him. We not only discuss politics but also literature. We exchange books also,” Bhattacharjee told reporters here.

He also denied reports that West Bengal government was seeking removal of Gandhi from the post.","West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya expressed regret for his previous statement regarding the Nandigram violence, stating that the villagers targeted by CPM cadres were “paid back in their own coin.” He admitted that he should not have made such remarks.

0477ce901b2836dd587205ab6347c51d,"[DOC 1]  All the hype and hoopla over the drugs case against Aryan Khan has come to nothing. Almost eight months after the registration of the case, in which the 24-year-old star kid spent 26 days in custody, the narcotics control bureau has given him and five other accused persons a clean chit.

The special investigation team of the NCB on Friday filed a 6,000-page charge sheet naming 14 accused. The agency said that the names of six persons, who were made accused by the earlier investigating team, including Aryan, Avin Sahu, Gopal Anand, Samir Sehgal, Bhaskar Arora and Manav Singhal have been dropped from the charge sheet for the “lack of sufficient evidence”.

In a statement, deputy director general Sanjay Kumar Singh of the NCB said, “SIT carried out an investigation in an objective manner. The touchstone of the principle of proof beyond reasonable doubt has been applied. Based on the investigation carried out by SIT, a complaint against 14 persons under various sections of NDPS Act is being filed. Complaint against rest six persons is not being filed due to lack of sufficient evidence.”

Among the five others exonerated in the case, Sahu was a guest of the cruise ship and the remaining four persons were the organisers of the party.

The charge sheet has been filed against Aryan’s friend Arbaaz Merchant (26), Munmun Dhamecha (28), Vikrant Chhokar (33), Mohak Jaiswal (28), Ishmeet Singh Chadha (33), Gomit Chopra (28), Nupur Satija (29), Abdul Kadar Shaikh (30), Shreyas Nair (23), Manish Rajgariya (30), Aachit Kumar (22), Chinedu Igwe (27), Shivraj Harijan (33) and Okoro Uzeoma (40).

An NCB team headed by then NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede raided the Cordelia Cruise Ship docked at Mumbai cruise terminal and claimed to have busted a drug party. The team arrested several people including Aryan from the ship. Though the investigators did not recover any drugs from Aryan’s position, they allegedly recovered six grams of charas from Merchant and five grams of hashish from Dhamecha.

Aryan was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 28 last year. In its order, the HC held that prima facie there was no evidence to infer that Aryan and his friend Arbaaz Merchant conspired to commit offences under the NDPS Act.

Following several controversies courted by Mr Wankhede’s style of function and personal allegations against him, the investigation was handed over to an SIT from NCB (New Delhi), headed by Sanjay Kumar Singh on November 6, 2021.

Welcoming the NCB’s admission that there wasn’t sufficient evidence against Aryan and no drugs were recovered from him, his lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, “The arrest and detention of Aryan Khan for 26 days was unjustified more particularly when he was not found in possession of any drugs, there was no evidence of any kind, there was no material of any nature of the violation of any law much less the NDPS Act. We are happy that the Special Investigation Team under Sanjay Kumar Singh investigated the case in an objective manner and decided not to file a complaint against Aryan Khan for lack of sufficient evidence. God is great. Satya Meva Jayate.”","The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in India has reportedly given a clean chit to Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, in a drug case. The NCB's special investigation team filed a 6,000-page charge sheet naming 14 accused, but dropped the names of six individuals, including Aryan Khan, due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Aryan Khan spent 26 days in custody last year after being arrested in connection with a drug party on a cruise ship. His lawyer welcomed the decision, stating that Aryan Khan's arrest and detention were unjustified, as he was not found in possession of any drugs.

41ce3003a8d9bd714f1d1433bd2aae72,"[DOC 1] No Rest in the Kingdom , a black comedy by Deepika Arwind, tells about how women deal with misogyny in their daily lives. The performance looks at the female performer’s body as a site of protest.

The play, a powerful one-woman physical theatre, performed at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) on Saturday, draws from the lives of urban characters who speak similar languages of consumerism and technology.

Daily annoyances
It deals with daily annoyances of being a woman in the country.

Masculinity in South Asia, especially India, is asserted and celebrated widely, says Deepika. “Its conventional manifestations are varied and dangerous, infecting different aspects of everyday life. Whether through the perpetration of rape culture in cinema and politics, or the palpable anxiety of the female body on the street, masculinity occupies oppressively large spaces, literally and figuratively,” she says.

Subverting masculinity
No Rest in the Kingdom has been created out of the desire to embody and subvert expressions of this masculinity through the body of a female performer, she says.

The kingdom is the current society where we live, where women are subjected to daily discrimination and violence.

Blurring the boundaries of genders, the actor embodies a variety of characters — male, female and feline — representing a gender and inter-species fluidity. The cat is a powerful motif that runs through the play.

How might her body, alone and vulnerable, serve as a metaphor for gender insensitivity and antagonism? How can her body transform into multiple sites of protest and how can humour, irreverence, and playfulness become her primary weapons of dissent and opposition?

This show has travelled to find resonance in different countries because its characters are archetypes of ‘masculinity’ familiar across cultures.

The play causes discomfort, sometimes scepticism. It breeds introspection and provokes conversations, Deepika says.

She avoids clichés, does not preach. But the play holds a mirror to the audience.

The characters she portrays sent the audience to howls of laughter.

But for every woman in the audience, there were scenes that they can identify deeply with. The play is produced by Sandbox Collective.","No Rest in the Kingdom, a one-woman black comedy by Deepika Arwind, explores how women confront everyday misogyny in society. Performed at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala, the play uses physical theatre to portray urban characters navigating consumerism and technology. It subverts traditional masculinity through humor and the female body as a protest tool. The performance blurs gender boundaries, using various archetypes to provoke introspection and challenge gender norms, resonating across cultures."
30fedb0510d5c5ece44a5742c5603cb9,"[DOC 1] Despite the rapid spread of Covid-19, several countries still haven't registered a single case of infection; Turkmenistan is one of them.

Many experts are concerned that the government of Turkmenistan may be hiding the truth, which could disrupt attempts to end the pandemic, reports the BBC.

Turkmenistan is holding a mass cycling rally to mark World Health Day on Tuesday; while the world battles coronavirus and more and more countries lock down their populations.

The Central Asian country is one of the most repressive states in the world and claims it still has zero coronavirus cases.

""Official health statistics from Turkmenistan are notoriously unreliable,"" said Professor Martin McKee from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has studied the Turkmen healthcare system.

""For the past decade they have claimed to have no people living with HIV/Aids, a figure that is not plausible. We also know that, in the 2000s, they suppressed evidence of a series of outbreaks, including plague.""

Many in Turkmenistan are even afraid of suggesting Covid-19 may already be in the country.

""My acquaintance who works in a state agency told me that I shouldn't say that the virus is here or that I heard about it, otherwise I may get into trouble,"" said a resident of the capital Ashgabat, who asked to remain anonymous.

The Turkmen authorities are, however, working on tackling a possible outbreak. Together with UN agencies in the country, they are discussing a plan of action.

The UN Resident Co-ordinator, Elena Panova said the plan included country level co-ordination, risk communication, case investigation, laboratory diagnostics and other measures.

When asked whether the UN trusted the official figures showing Turkmenistan had no confirmed Covid-19 cases, Panova avoided giving a straight answer.

""We are relying on official information because this is what all countries are doing,"" she said.

""There is no question of trust because that's the way it works.""

Panova said early measures on restricting travel might have contributed to lack of confirmed cases.

Turkmenistan closed most of its land border crossings more than a month ago. It also cancelled flights to China and some other countries in early February and started diverting all international flights from the capital to Turkmenabat in the north-east, where a quarantine zone was created.

However, according to several residents, some people were able bribe their way out of the zone and avoid two weeks of isolation in a tent.

Panova said everyone arriving in the country and those showing symptoms were being tested for Covid-19. However, she could not give exact figures of how many tests were conducted a day and how many test kits Turkmenistan had overall.

""What we understand in talking to government officials is that they have sufficient tests.""

""However, if there is an outbreak that's a huge pressure on the health system like in any other country. So, irrespective of how much you have prepared, it usually is insufficient. That's why we are already talking to them about procuring ventilators, and also other types of equipment.""

Movement between cities has been restricted and those who enter Ashgabat must now have a doctor's note.

Markets and offices are being fumigated with smoke from a type of grass called yuzarlik, used in herbal remedies, after President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov said burning it would ward off the virus - despite there being no evidence.

Unlike most of the world, daily life in Turkmenistan continues as normal. Cafes and restaurants are open. Crowds gather for weddings. Nobody wears masks and mass events are going ahead.

It appears the country is in denial about admitting the major threat posed by coronavirus.

","Despite global concerns over COVID-19, Turkmenistan claims zero cases, sparking skepticism. Experts fear government suppression of information, citing past instances of concealing outbreaks. Residents hesitate to acknowledge the virus, fearing repercussions. While the UN discusses preparedness, trust in official figures remains uncertain. Turkmenistan closed borders and implemented travel restrictions but faces bribery allegations for quarantine evasion. Testing rates and equipment availability are unclear. President Berdymukhamedov promotes unproven remedies as daily life carries on unaffected, with no masks worn and events proceeding. Turkmenistan's response raises doubts about addressing the pandemic, portraying a state seemingly in denial.

(His official 4 Rajaji Marg residence is under renovation.) His twin Dachshunds, Dash and Tickle, shoot around like little guided torpedoes clad in identical red-and- black-trimmed winter fleece. Staff officers and Tavor rifle-wielding bodyguards of the special forces flank the fleet of black armoured Scorpios waiting to make the short two km drive to his office deep within the sandstone corridors of South Block. The general appears in the verandah of his home, proffers a firm handshake. He's of medium height, stockily built, with salt and pepper hair and a neatly trimmed white moustache. He listens carefully, looks you in the eye when he speaks, and the clearly articulated sentences are delivered like a military drum roll. He clearly plays on the front foot. There is simply no question that will induce any hesitation on his part, from tackling China and Pakistan, surgical strikes, the controversial Cold Start war doctrine to the polemic around his selection as army chief, superseding two senior army commanders. As he sat down for an extensive interview with Executive Editor Sandeep Unnithan, General Rawat revealed why he was supremely confident of navigating the minefield that lies ahead in his three-year tenure. Excerpts:What do you see as your main security challenges and how do you plan to handle developments like the reorganisation of China's armed forces?The primary role of the armed forces is the defence of the borders, preparation for conventional warfare, maintaining internal security and focusing on disaster relief. We are studying the restructuring of the PLA to see its efficacy. We will study their reforms and see whether they have relevance in our context. If so, we will put them across with modifications to the government.The army's China-specific Mountain Strike Corps has been languishing for want of funds. Is this relevant in our context?We raised the Mountain Strike Corps (MSC) as part of a transition from dissuasion and deterrence to credible deterrence. All adversaries respect credible strength, which comes from such formations capable of striking across the border. We are expected to remain defensive in order to ensure there are no incursions and the sanctity of the borders is maintained. But you cannot always remain defensive. We must also have the capability to conduct offensive operations. Whether these forces are going to be used physically will depend on the situation, but surely these forces meet the purpose of credible deterrence. So, we'll certainly give impetus to raising the corps. The government has given us permission to induct manpower, infrastructure development along the border is taking place, weapons and equipment are coming in.Did the army's September 29, 2016 surgical strikes define our new red lines in a strong response to a high-casualty attack by terrorists?All nations and armies define their own thresholds. The December 13, 2001 Parliament attack was a threshold. In a terrorist attack, it is the nature of the attack and the success the terrorists are able to achieve-sometimes what happens is that the terrorists get success because of incidental damage caused. Uri, for example, was an incidental success because there were troops in tents, troops who were grouped together. In Nagrota, they did not get so much success, they did not get so many people, we were able to eliminate them before they could do damage. So the threshold level will vary and [determine] the kind of reaction, because our nation is not a warmongering nation. We want peace and tranquility, and if we find that something can be resolved through negotiations, an attempt is always made to resolve it through negotiations but if we find these incidents getting repeated, we define a threshold, a decision is taken, recommendations are made, and we will go across again. It is very difficult to say if there are red lines (in response to terrorist attacks). What I can say is that there are dotted lines, and those dots are then joined together by us to draw a red line.Is the Cold Start doctrine-instituted after Operation Parakram in 2001-still an option in response to attacks like the one on Parliament in 2001 or 26/11 in Mumbai?The Cold Start doctrine exists for conventional military operations. Whether we have to conduct conventional operations for such strikes is a decision well-thought through, involving the government and the Cabinet Committee on Security.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, in the combined commanders' conference in 2015, said that future conflicts will become shorter, and wars will become rare. Do you have any strategy for short, intense wars?In our case, we prepare for short, intense conflicts, and at the same time have to be prepared for wars becoming long-drawn. Based on that, we have a well-defined strategy. What the PM said is right; wars will be intense and short because there'll always be international pressure in wars between two nations. We have to be aware of that; whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready and have to achieve success.The modernisation of the Indian Army has been an area of major concern for you and your predecessors. Have you identified any key areas for delivery during your tenure?Technology is constantly changing. You cannot be using older technologies for your weapons systems and equipment. My thinking is that you have to look at emerging technology because of the time it takes for a weapons system to be inducted into the armed forces. So you have to look at tomorrow's technology for inducting weapons. With that in mind, we have also focused on certain weapons systems. Infantry is the most affected-deployed along the border round the clock, in internal security situations, and in the face of frequent ceasefire violations on the border-we need to give them modern weapons technology best suited to such an environment. The mechanised forces need future battle tanks and Infantry Combat Vehicles, new aviation assets, air defence systems, artillery and other longer ranged weapon systems that have more lethality and accuracy. We are also looking at upgrading operational logistics systems. The modernisation priorities have been spelt out by my predecessor [Gen. Dalbir Singh] and we are continuing with the same vision and thrust areas because I feel they have been thought through and holistically define the army's requirements.Do you see an emerging threat in the new China-Pakistan proximity and how do you propose to respond to it?National security strategy by any nation is defined by its national interests. China has defined its national interests by coming close to Pakistan in looking for access to the Indian Ocean Region, for energy security, trade. Today, economics defines national strategy and wherever people find economic gain, there are cooperative mechanisms and alliances. We also have to look at our national interests and continue doing whatever is best in our national interests. We will also counter such mechanisms through our own means; our government is quite capable of handling [these]. We are also carrying out actions to negate the nexus developing between China and Pakistan.Would you elaborate on these measures?We are addressing the neighbourhood, the extended neighborhood and the Far West. We are looking at certain countries on China's eastern seaboard, and the Americas. There are groupings that are taking place. While we are proud of being non-aligned, there are times when you have to get into some groupings, which is of course in the domain of foreign policy, so I wouldn't like to really comment. We have masters in foreign policy and they do it really well. Our diplomacy is moving well, the prime minister's focus is on the global arena, we will be able to counter whatever is happening through our foreign policy.What are your expectations from a closer military partnership with the United States?Our expectations are that we must live like friends - the economic partnership will grow stronger and everything else will fall into place. We are sharing expertise but that is more in the field of humanitarian assistance and disaster response. We do try out some joint training as far as counter-insurgency [is concerned]. The US does consider us a lead nation in Counter Insurgency Ops; they have specialisation in special forces operations which we look at. As for equipment, we have a system of global tendering, and I feel we should go for whoever gives us the best. Finally, we should support our domestic industry. What it will depend on is who is willing to come here, share technology and help our domestic industry grow and help us in becoming self-reliant, so we needn't be country-fixated.We have been hearing a lot about the rivalry between the infantry and the armoured corps. Would you set the record straight on this?
","Newly-appointed Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has said that the Indian forces would cross the border again if peace and tranquility are not maintained after attempting to resolve things through negotiations. ""Wars will be intense and short because there will always be international pressure... Whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready,"" Rawat added.

521ad294fba58c02a3efa01a89f0d207,"[DOC 1] It is indeed tragic that our MPs can use any trick in the book to bring to a halt any serious business that needs to be done for the development of our country. Their behaviour, their use of language and their lack of any level of tolerance is something that shames the system of parliamentary democracy every time the House is in session.
We elect our MPs to work and ensure that they represent the people; we also recognise that many of them have huge personal agendas. What we need is legislation from our sessions, not just high decibel drivel. And this is exactly what the Indian Parliament has come to. Debates are out of the window and have instead been replaced by duels, often of the non-verbal kind.
I would imagine some of our MPs are slowly losing a sense of their responsibility but more importantly they stay cocooned, protected by parliamentary privilege. The oratory of parliamentarians such as Nehru, Piloo Mody, Vajpayee has been replaced by a rustic drawl and undignified behaviour.
Can we change this? I am certain we can. The Speaker needs to be even more firm than he is; members need to be expelled; expunging their comments will not suffice. I also recommend telecast of parliamentary proceedings live through the day â€” which is when you will see how some of our MPs use the House as an effective sleep chamber than a chamber for crafting legislation.
MPs in India are a favoured lot. And the tragedy is they know it better than anyone else. They get amazing perks: from free travel up to a certain limit to subsidised meals to free telephone calls and free medical benefits â€” all on taxpayerâ€™s money. Some of us may think this justified as they are working hard for us. But when sessions get disrupted as often as they do, when legislation is replaced by rowdy behaviour, all we are left with is their perks and no pro-gress. This is my real worry. At this stage of our development we cannot be subsidising bad behaviour only to remain within the propriety of what has been traditional in a manner of speaking.
The only way we can change all this is by urgently indexing all compensation for MPs to the amount of work they do in the House. Recall their perks; remove all the freebies till real work gets done. We are not a nation that can afford for our policy-makers to be using the venerable House as a soap-box at Hyde Park. The day we are able to index compensation to effectiveness we will see a new culture within the Houses. Till then, some of our more accomplished and venerable MPs will be as sad as probably we are, at seeing the gradual demise of yet another great institution in India.
","Concerns are raised over the disruptive behavior of Members of Parliament (MPs) in India, impacting legislative work. The author suggests solutions like stricter enforcement by the Speaker, expulsion of disruptive members, and live telecasts for enhanced accountability. The piece also proposes linking MPs' compensation to their performance in the House to prioritize responsibilities.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi trained his guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his failure to address the issue of alleged corruption by the BJP government in Karnataka.

Speaking at an election rally in Chamarajanagar near here on Monday, Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister remains mum on the alleged corruption during the BJP regime in Karnataka that has earned notoriety as a “40 percent commission” Government.

Though the Contractors’ Association of Karnataka wrote to him a letter alleging the demand for 40 percent commission by the representatives of the government to clear the bills of the contractors, Mr. Modi did not even bother to reply to the letter, he said. Mr. Gandhi also cited the seizure of ₹8 crore from the residence of a BJP MLA’s son recently in the Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited scandal as a case in point.

8b79c215ea355c74bd8a11958d2e43a5,"[DOC 1] MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Saturday cautioned new Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis against taking the people for granted and asked him to fulfil the expectations of the common man.

“The new government is like a newly-wed woman who initially pleases her mother-in-law. In this case the mother-in-law is the people of Maharashtra. You cannot take people for granted. They have the power to pull your ears when you err,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said. 

This is the first lesson the new government will have to learn, the Sena said amid signs of a rapprochement between the saffron parties, who parted ways on September 25, just weeks before the Assembly polls, which saw BJP emerging as the single largest party in the state.

It is true that there is no magic wand to fulfil promises made (during polls) but people of Maharashtra are looking at the new government, the first led by BJP, with a lot of hope, the publication said.

“Mantralaya (the State Secretariat) was gutted during the Congress-NCP rule but the aspirations of people had turned into ashes much before that. The new Chief Minister should ensure that his work is like the proverbial Phoenix which rose from the ashes,” the Sena organ maintained.

Describing Friday’s swearing-in ceremony of the Fadnavis-led Ministry as grand (it was also attended by corporate bigwigs), the Sena said the poor, and not the rich or money bags, should get the attention of the administration as was the case during Shivaji’s era. 

“Fadnavis has said he will emulate Shivaji Maharaj’s example while ruling the state. He should remember that the real strength of Shivaji’s Hindavi swarajya was not the seth and sahukars but the common poor folk.”

Thackeray attended the inauguration ceremony at Wankhede Stadium after a call from BJP president Amit Shah and other leaders. The party had earlier announced it would keep off the mega event, attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing “constant humiliation” by BJP ahead of Government formation.

Sena MP Vinayak Raut on Friday said Shah had assured Thackeray of a positive decision on participation of his party in the BJP Government. ","The Shiv Sena issued a cautionary message to Maharashtra's new Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis, urging him to prioritize fulfilling the expectations of the common people. In an editorial in their mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena likened the new government's relationship with the people to that of a newly-wed woman and her mother-in-law, emphasizing that the administration should not take the public for granted. Despite recent tensions between the Shiv Sena and BJP, signs of reconciliation have emerged following the Assembly polls. The Sena stressed the importance of the new government addressing the aspirations of the people, highlighting the need for governance that uplifts the common citizen. While acknowledging the grandeur of Fadnavis' swearing-in ceremony, the Sena underscored the importance of prioritizing the welfare of the poor over corporate interests, drawing parallels to the leadership of Shivaji Maharaj. The Sena's attendance at the inauguration ceremony signaled a potential thaw in relations with BJP, following assurances from BJP president Amit Shah regarding the party's participation in the government."
0abba4e410e4dc0d6399a14f74bcea70,"[DOC 1] In an era where economic disparity is at its peak, one can always rely on the Ambanis to provide the much-needed comic relief. The recent splurge on Anant Ambani’s wedding has once again reminded us why the rich remain rich – by spending copious amounts of money on events that could rival entire national budgets. How dare they? Let’s dive into the outrage, shall we?

When news broke that Mukesh Ambani, India’s wealthiest man, had decided to spend a small fortune on his son Anant’s wedding, the collective gasp could be heard across the globe. “How inconsiderate,” cried the masses, “to spend money that could have been used to solve world hunger on a mere wedding!”

Indeed, it was a sight to behold. Lavish decorations that could have been mistaken for the set of a Bollywood blockbuster, celebrities who charged appearance fees higher than the GDP of some small countries, and an orchestra that probably cost more than a new fleet of Rolls-Royces. Oh, the horror!

Of course, this grandiose display did not sit well with the common man. “Where is our bailout?” screamed a small business owner, forgetting momentarily that he wouldn’t want to share the limelight with the glitzy guest list. “What about the poor?” questioned an armchair activist, conveniently ignoring their penchant for imported avocado toast.

The public outcry was fierce. Twitter threads, Facebook rants, and WhatsApp forwards spread like wildfire. “How can they be so out of touch?” they asked, while simultaneously queuing up for the latest iPhone release.

It’s a well-known fact that the rich should only spend their money on the poor. Extravagance is reserved for the middle class, who can proudly show off their small luxuries without facing the wrath of public scrutiny. The Ambanis’ decision to host a wedding that could feed a small nation was, therefore, a moral affront.

Philanthropy, after all, is best done quietly and without drawing attention. Unlike a wedding, where privacy is tantamount to scandal. How dare they use their own money to make their own choices? The nerve!

The first tragedy, of course, lies in the excessive luxury. What society needs now more than ever is for its billionaires to show restraint. The millions of roses imported from the farthest corners of the globe are a clear affront to the simple bouquet enthusiasts. The fleets of private jets ferrying guests have, undoubtedly, caused immense psychological trauma to the humble bike riders of the nation.

In all this hullabaloo, one might overlook the fact that the money spent on Anant Ambani’s wedding did indeed go back into the economy. Thousands of jobs were created, artisans found work, Justin Beiber, Rihanna, and Bollywood actors found work, and the hospitality industry saw a boom. But let’s not get bogged down by such trivialities. The real issue here is that the rich should feel guilty about their wealth – and that guilt should translate into a modest, preferably invisible, lifestyle.

Imagine the distress of the elite class, whose own weddings now appear humble in comparison. What is a diamond-studded cake when Anant Ambani’s dessert table is a glittering mountain? The deep psychological scars left on the wealthy who must now up their game to remain relevant cannot be understated. Sympathy cards are in order for these besieged souls, struggling under the weight of outshone opulence.

It’s fascinating to note the thin line between envy and indignation. The same people who cry foul over the Ambani’s extravagance wouldn’t bat an eyelid if given the chance to attend such a grand affair. Oh, to rub shoulders with the elite, to be a part of the spectacle! But alas, they are left to watch from afar, simmering in their self-righteous fury.

While it’s true that the Ambani family has engaged in philanthropy, it is, frankly, not enough. Feeding the hungry, providing education, and funding healthcare are all well and good, but what we really need is a billionaire who embraces asceticism. Why build hospitals when one can build modest bamboo huts and set a true example?

As the echoes of Anant Ambani’s wedding celebrations fade, we are left to ponder the true cost of such opulence. The solution, as always, lies in our collective inaction. Let us sit back, continue to critique from our high horses, and do nothing substantive to address wealth disparity. After all, it’s much easier to bemoan the splurges of the rich than to engage in meaningful societal change. In the end, the tragicomedy of Anant Ambani’s wedding serves as a poignant reminder: the real problem isn’t the billionaires’ spending; it’s our insistence on not looking in the mirror.

So here’s to the beautiful couple, Radhika Merchant and Anant Ambani, and their fabulously opulent wedding. Stay blessed!","The extravagant wedding of Anant Ambani, hosted by Mukesh Ambani, has sparked widespread outrage over the perceived misuse of wealth. Critics argue that such lavish spending—replete with opulent decorations and high-profile celebrities—should be redirected towards addressing global issues like poverty. Public outcry highlights the irony of the elite's splurges, which are seen as a moral affront, despite the economic benefits of such events, including job creation and industry stimulation. The satire underscores a broader societal issue: the disparity between the rich’s opulence and the public’s expectations for modesty, revealing a deeper discontent with wealth inequality and hypocrisy."

District collector Madhukar Kokate, who is also the returning officer for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, had issued orders to the PMC, in accordance with the election code of conduct.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, additional municipal commissioner D.S. Zagade said the election code prohibits political parties or their well-wishers from installing such unauthorised hoardings or banners, which could influence the voter.

Zagade said he has appointed all the 14 divisional ward officers as nodal officers to carry out the drive against the illegal hoardings â€” expenses of which are not accounted for by the political parties.


Exercising these powers, the civic teams headed by the 14 ward officers have so far removed around 1,463 banners, 229 hoardings, 162 cut-outs and 133 posters. While asserting that the civic staff will continue with its action, Zagade has issued letters to the chiefs of all political parties in the city, appealing to them to direct their party workers to stay away from installing such illegal posters, banners or posters.","The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has undertaken drives to remove approximately 2,000 unauthorized banners, posters, and cut-outs erected by various political parties across the city.

New Delhi has decided to beef up security for Indians working on several government projects in Afghanistan. Two special teams sent to Afghanistan to review the security situation last month have, however, ruled out recalling Indians working there. The teams, made up of senior security experts and external affairs ministry officials, have instead recommended that additional security personnel be deployed to ensure the safety of Indians associated with ""humanitarian"" projects.
 
The security review was carried out after five Indians took refuge at the Indian consulate in Kandahar (reported in HT) after receiving life threats in December last year. The two doctors and three paramedics attached to the Indian medical mission in the city are still at the consulate but attend the medical mission daily.
 
While in Kabul, the two teams met with local security authorities to discuss ways of enhancing security for Indians attached to projects that can't be halted midway. It has also been decided that intelligence exchange will be intensified.

According to sources, it is evident that the threats being issued to Indians to abandon their work and leave Afghanistan are serious and not a ""one-off"" incident. There is reportedly enough evidence gathered by local intelligence and Indian authorities to indicate that these threats are coming from resurgent Taliban groups still active along the Afghan-Pak border.An MEA official has disclosed that the Taliban continues to issue threats to Indians. ""The security situation is far from comfortable. This was known when India started its projects there. At the same time, it is imperative to carry on with the humanitarian work there. Those manning hospitals, dispensaries and involved with road construction projects were fully aware before leaving for Afghanistan that they would have to work under adverse security conditions.""

According to the official, Indian doctors attend to as many as 300 patients a day. The Indian medical mission on the Iran-Afghanistan border is the only place for medical aid in the region.","India has decided to strengthen security for its citizens working on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan, amid serious threats believed to be issued by resurgent Taliban groups operating near the Afghan-Pakistan border.

Following threats in Kandahar last December, where five Indian medical staff took refuge at the consulate, two expert teams were sent to review security. Their report ruled out recalling Indians but recommended deploying additional security personnel.

Meetings in Kabul led to agreements on enhanced intelligence sharing and cooperation with Afghan authorities. Despite dangers, Indian officials insist that their mission must continue, especially given the critical services provided—like the Indian medical mission, which treats up to 300 patients a day and serves as the only healthcare center in the region."

206f151ff6a830c09b2eb866da6a2843,"[DOC 1] NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal has passed an interim order allowing Sterlite Copper to restart operations at its Tuticorin smelter, lifting temporarily a shutdown ordered by the state pollution control board two months ago.

Questioning the scientific basis of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board’s “punitive” decision, the tribunal on Friday said the company could restart operations within a week under the watch of a committee being sent to check on the plant and its anti-polluting equipment.



Sterlite, operated by London-listed Vedanta, has said the shutdown since March 29 has led to a production loss of 60,000 tonnes. The smelter accounts for more than half of the country’s copper production.

The tribunal said TNPCB had acted on “apprehension, at best” that Sterlites’ 400,000-tonne copper smelter had emitted excessive sulphuric acid on March 23 and aggrieved locals.


“The action of the board would suffer from the voice of arbitrariness if it collected no data, whatsoever, during 23-29 and passed the impugned order in an abrupt manner. This appears to be correct,” said Justice Swatanter Kumar.

The tribunal’s oral order would be followed by written justification since the case involved much data-based arguments.

While TNPCB claimed that it had acted on villagers’ complaints of breathing difficulty, vomiting and eye irritation, the tribunal found the charge against Sterlite unsubstantiated.

Besides, an investigation team, comprising two IIT Madras professors, sent by the tribunal had “made no adverse comment on the functioning of the plant and largely found it in consonance with scientific requirements”.

The tribunal said TNPC, whose automatic monitoring of emissions had not been working for the last two years, had failed to prove that alleged excess emission had necessarily emanated from Sterlite’s plant and not from any of the other industrial unit that released gasses like amoniac and chlorine that could cause similar symptoms.

It questioned the claim that villagers staying 8 km away from the plant were reportedly inconvenienced by higher emissions, but no complaints came from anyone closer to the plant.

The tribunal also found it strange that the district collector, acting on these complaints, had constituted an inspection team. “Its report is yet to see the light of day.”

Sterlite claims its invested Rs 150 crore in environmental control mechanisms in the last two years alone.

“The absolute shortage of cooper has led to a lot of imports. It also affected our long-term customers who could not find immediate quantities to import at such a short notice,” said P Ramnath, its CEO.

The committee that will monitor Sterlite’s plant is expected to make three visits to look into the functioning of the plant and its anti-pollution equipment. The panel will include member secretary Central Pollution Control Board, member secretary Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the two IIT professors who made up the earlier committee.

TNPCB is being allowed only weekly inspections, unless approved by the committee. In their presence, Sterlite will restart operations within a week.

On April 2, the Supreme Court, in another environment charge against Sterlite, led by Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Vaiko, had fined the company Rs 1 crore for polluting its plant environment between 1997 to 2012, but stayed a 2010 Madras High Court directive to shut the smelter altogether. Vaiko, who was present in court on Friday, told ET, “My concern is the welfare of the people of Tuticorin. I will continue my crusade against this plant that has been releasing poisonous and toxic gasses into the environment.”","The National Green Tribunal has issued an interim order allowing Sterlite Copper to resume operations at its Tuticorin smelter, overturning a shutdown ordered by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) two months ago. The tribunal criticized TNPCB's decision as lacking scientific basis and acting hastily based on unsubstantiated complaints from villagers about health issues allegedly caused by the smelter. It highlighted that an investigation team found no adverse comments on the plant's operations and suggested TNPCB had not effectively monitored emissions. Sterlite Copper, a major producer in India, welcomed the decision citing significant production losses during the shutdown."

those at its departments, conducted institutions and affiliated colleges to join work from Monday.
The teachers are worried mainly because they feel not just them but also their families would be exposed to the
virus when they start venturing out for work.
They say there is no likelihood of classes as students aren’t likely to turn up. Many colleges are insisting on
compulsory five-hour stay even if there’s no work.
Acting vice chancellor Murlidhar Chandekar and acting registrar Niraj Khati didn’t answer TOI’s calls.
When asked, officiating Pro-VC SR Chaudhari said vacation period is over and the joining of employees would be
as per the state government and local administration orders. “Teachers would be required for preparation of econtent, and other assessment works. 15% or 15 employees whichever is more have been asked to come as per
the orders. There is possibility that exams may be conducted. In such case, readying the exam centre would be
done by teachers,” he said.
Chaudhari added that the principals will have to decide on the strength of teachers to be called to colleges and
others can work from home.
In its order dated June 12, the NU cited the state government and NMC orders regarding Mission Begin Again.
The acting registrar ordered the colleges to ensure attendance of teachers in the office at their individual level.
The state order states that colleges offices/staff of education institutions (universities/colleges/schools can operate

However, the NMC bars opening of schools, colleges, educational training and coaching institutions etc.
NU officials admitted the notification issued by the registrar lacks clarity and therefore there is resentment
among teachers.
They said the Marathwada University has specified that teachers can perform non-academic work home from
June 16 to 30, which is start of the new academic year.
“The word “employees” in the notification has left teachers at the mercy of principals who will take a call. Also, the
state government has made it a must for all employees to attend office at least once in a week or he will be
marked leave without pay,” they said.
","Nagpur University (NU) has mandated that teachers return to work amid rising Covid-19 cases, causing concerns about virus exposure for themselves and their families. Teachers are expected to prepare e-content and handle assessment tasks.

legislations aimed at financial sector reforms in the ongoing session of
Parliament, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee's repeated assurances
notwithstanding.
Trinamool Congress, a constituent of the Congress-led coalition at the Centre,
continues to oppose the three key bills identified by the government to signal
recovery from policy paralysis.
Samajwadi Party, which lends outside support to the ruling coalition and is
not known to be as ideologically rigid as the Trinamool Congress, has not yet
backed the bills eitherThe government had named the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development
Authority Bill, along with the insurance and banking amendment bills, as its
top legislative priority this session, which will end on May 22.
That the government was not keen to create coalition discord over financial
sector reform bills was evident when Mukherjee refrained from seeking the
Cabinet's approval for the insurance bill on Thursday evening. ""We can take
this up at later,"" Mukherjee is learnt to have told the Cabinet.
Earlier, Trinamool Congress parliamentary party leader Sudip Bandopadhyay
told ET: ""We will not back the pension reform bill. Mamata has already
conveyed this to the government leadership.""
Interestingly, BJP, the principal opposition in Parliament, has offered to
support the pension bill. But the government is dragging its feet over the
legislations, BJP leader, and former finance minister, Yashwant Sinha told ET.
Analysts say Congress, despite its pro-reform approach, does not wish to be
seen as joining hands with its principal adversary to bypass the reservations of
some of its allies.
Mamata Banerjee's party has been opposing the pension reform legislation
mainly because investment of pension funds in stock markets does not
provide assured returns. Trinamool also has a longstanding opposition toforeign direct investment.
In his reply to the debate on the finance bill on Tuesday, Mukherjee had
acknowledged that investors were keeping off India. ""Yes, some of the Indian
investors also feel shy of making investments in India,"" he said, even as he
added,","Key financial sector reform bills in India may not pass in the current Parliament session despite Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's assurances. The Trinamool Congress opposes these bills, and the Samajwadi Party has not yet backed them.

70c6d03e9d2152a12a78939bae4b87e4,"[DOC 1] DR Pushpa M Bhargava, a former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology is the vice-chairman of the National Knowledge Commission (NKC) constituted by the Prime Minister. No such commission exists anywhere in the world, and with its unique and exciting mandate it is capable of “transforming society,” believes Dr Bhargava. We explored what the NKC is setting itself up to do.

Q: Could you set out the NKC’s mandate?

A: There are broadly three objectives. The first is to make India a leader in generation of new knowledge in all fields. We do generate new knowledge, with individual peaks, but as a nation we are not a leader.

The second is to make India a knowledge based society. Affluence and a knowledge based society, or even being a knowledge leader, do not go together. The US is an example. The goal is to give people access to information, not to convert them to any point of view.

The third is to make governance and industry knowledge based. The higher up you go the more the requirement for a knowledge base. But the higher up you go the less there is of it. That is the tragedy.

Q: How will you translate this vision into action?

A: We shall present no reports. We shall only be presenting points of action. We have ensured that we are not tied to government rules. With this freedom comes great responsibility. There is a budget of Rs 4.6 crore this year. We will be releasing a statement of account, a utilisation certificate, and we will put everything on the net.

Q: What are the elements of your action plan?

A: The draft document has been finalised and will be ready for release, perhaps by February. Certain decisions have already been taken, and priority areas identified. This will also be on the web for feedback. The active recommendations are here as well — where an Act will be needed, where a ministerial decision, a cabinet decision etc. We will have meetings in at least 10 cities, with paid advertisements, inviting people to come.

Q: The priority areas are obviously science, education and the like?

A: Yes, priority one areas are education at all levels (school, technical, university) science and technology, agriculture and the rural sector, traditional knowledge, and governance, including e-governance. The second tier comprises the social sciences, medical and health care, civil society, patents.

Q: Can you elaborate on education?

A: The UGC is completely inadequate. My personal view, we have to discuss this in the NKC, is that we need to totally ban commercialisation of education, but encourage privatisation. Harvard, Cambridge are private but not commercial institutions. Money goes back into the university. It is not an investment, no individual makes money. Then there is this terrible pain of affiliated colleges. No country in the world has such institutions. We have made all the calculations and we are convinced that spending 6 per cent of GDP on education is an achievable goal. We need 400,000 schools. If we can do that, make sure that no child is refused education, even reservations won’t be needed in the future.

Q: What about science and technology, basic science?

A: If we create a large base, excellence will emerge. In the short term, and the PM is very keen we do something in the short term, we have some ideas. One way is to get senior scientists from India and abroad, and talented youngsters, with a vision and an ability to excite people, to get together for brain-storming sessions in various fields. We will identify major unsolved problems in those areas. Then we say, who wants to work on it? Tell me what you need, you will get it.

Q: At some point, you are going to run into ideological debates.

A: Our recommendations will be based on reason, with the largest interests of the country in mind. People are not fools. They will see through anything else. We would like to give our recommendations to farmers unions, all the trade unions; it will be on the net. Let us have feedback. Many of our recommendations will have serious opposition. If they are genuine, based on knowledge and reason, we will take it into account. If they are from vested interests, we will reject them.

Q: What about the relationship knowledge has with questions of spirituality, religion, identity, heritage and so on?

A: Values are never in conflict, but vague ill-defined concepts of spirituality will definitely be. Education about religion is fine, but not propagating religion. The mixing up of religion and history is not on either. As for identity, if we really want to act as a responsible knowledge commission, the first identity is the human identity. We owe something to the entire human race. The second identity is the national identity. The nation-state is a reality.

If the system of imparting knowledge is correct then these issues are resolved for every individual. There is a whole section on what kind of citizens we want to have, what the desirable values are. Simple things like not to make oneself an exception for rules. We want to go through a red light, but no one else should.

Q: What about language issues?

A: We are very clear on this, with a fair amount of consensus. The fact is that every child, every parent, in every town and village wants English, to be proficient in it. It is the politicians who don’t want them to have it. Our languages are important, certainly, but in the world of tomorrow, please do not create, and this may yet turn out to be the most significant divide, two classes — those who are proficient in English, and those who are not. It is the disadvantaged who will suffer.","The National Knowledge Commission (NKC) in India, led by Dr. Pushpa M Bhargava, aims to make India a leader in generating new knowledge, transform it into a knowledge-based society, and apply knowledge in governance and industry. The NKC emphasizes education, science, technology, agriculture, rural development, traditional knowledge, and governance. Dr. Bhargava advocates a ban on the commercialization of education, encouraging privatization without profit motive, and allocating 6% of GDP to education. The commission plans to engage in brain-storming sessions, seek feedback, and prioritize reason over ideological debates. Language issues, especially English proficiency, are considered essential for future opportunities."
0627d607f15a6210087f0957dd114bb1,"[DOC 1] A recent surge in mental health issues among students in Uttarakhand has raised alarm bells across educational institutions and health authorities. The idyllic hill state, known for its serene landscapes and prestigious educational institutions, is grappling with a growing crisis that demands urgent attention.

According to a comprehensive survey conducted by the Uttarakhand State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT) in early 2024, approximately 40% of students in the state reported experiencing significant levels of stress and anxiety. The study, which encompassed over 10,000 students from various schools and colleges, highlighted academic pressure, familial expectations, and social media influence as primary contributors to their mental health struggles.

Dr. Anupama Joshi, a renowned psychiatrist based in Dehradun, emphasized the gravity of the situation. “The mental health of our students is deteriorating at an alarming rate. The competitive academic environment, coupled with the lack of adequate mental health support, is taking a severe toll on young minds,” she stated.

In response to these findings, the Uttarakhand government has initiated several measures to address the crisis. The State Education Department, in collaboration with the Health Department, launched a Mental Health Awareness Campaign in March 2024. This campaign aims to educate students, parents, and educators about mental health issues and the importance of seeking help.

Additionally, the government has mandated the appointment of trained counselors in all schools and colleges by the end of 2024. As part of this initiative, over 500 counselors are currently undergoing training to equip them with the skills needed to support students effectively.

Rohit Kumar, a 17-year-old student from Nainital, shared his personal experience, highlighting the pervasive nature of the issue. “The pressure to perform well academically is immense. It’s not just about exams; it’s about constantly proving yourself. This constant stress makes it difficult to enjoy learning or even relax,” he lamented.

Compounding these mental health challenges is the limited availability of higher education opportunities within the state. Many students feel the added burden of needing to secure spots in institutions outside Uttarakhand to pursue their desired courses, leading to heightened stress and uncertainty about their futures. The lack of diverse and accessible higher education options locally exacerbates their anxiety, forcing many to leave their homes and support systems in search of better opportunities.

Educational institutions are also stepping up to combat the crisis. The Doon School in Dehradun has introduced a comprehensive mental health curriculum, which includes mindfulness practices, stress management workshops, and regular counseling sessions. Principal Rajiv Singh stressed the importance of creating a supportive environment. “We need to ensure that our students feel safe and supported. Mental health is as crucial as physical health, and we are committed to prioritizing it,” he affirmed.

Despite these efforts, challenges remain. Many students, especially in rural areas, still lack access to mental health resources and higher education opportunities. Dr. Rajesh Kumar, an educationist and social activist, pointed out, “While urban centers are seeing improvements, rural areas are lagging. We need to bridge this gap and ensure that every student, regardless of their location, has access to mental health support and educational opportunities.”

As Uttarakhand navigates this crisis, it is clear that a multi-faceted approach involving government intervention, community support, and educational reforms is essential. The mental well-being of students is paramount, and addressing this issue with urgency and compassion is critical for the future of the state’s youth.

The rising mental health concerns among students in Uttarakhand are a stark reminder of the need for a holistic approach to education—one that prioritizes mental well-being alongside academic achievement and accessible higher education opportunities. As efforts to tackle this issue continue, the hope is that students will find the support they need to thrive both mentally and academically within their home state.","In Uttarakhand, a concerning rise in mental health issues among students has prompted urgent action from authorities and educational institutions. A survey by SCERT in early 2024 revealed that 40% of students experience high levels of stress and anxiety, attributed to academic pressure, familial expectations, and social media influence. Dr. Anupama Joshi, a local psychiatrist, highlighted the severe toll of these pressures on young minds. In response, the Uttarakhand government has launched a Mental Health Awareness Campaign and mandated counselors in schools by 2024. Despite efforts, challenges like limited local higher education options persist, exacerbating students' stress. Comprehensive support and educational reforms are crucial to addressing these issues effectively and ensuring students' well-being across the state."

26eda18512a1d1438c879329ed08c270,"[DOC 1] Afghanistan’s cricketing rollercoaster ride stops off in Argentina this week with a place in the 2011 World Cup tantalisingly within reach. At the leafy Buenos Aires settings of the Hurlingham,Belgrano and St Albans Clubs,Afghanistan will tackle Argentina,Hong Kong,Uganda,Papua New Guinea and the Cayman Islands.

If they finish in the top two,they’ll progress to April’s World Cup qualifier in South Africa,the final testing ground ahead of the 2011 World Cup to be staged in India,Pakistan,Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

It’s a prospect which would have been unthinkable just over eight years ago when the Afghanistan cricket federation wasn’t even part of the International Cricket Council (ICC). But since their entry into ICC tournaments,they have been determined to show that there is more to Afghanistan than bloodshed and roadside bombs.

They surged through Division Five and Four of the World Cricket League with successive promotions,earning desperately-needed development cash along the way as well as plaudits.

One regional Afghan governor was even reported to have given the players plots of land on which to build homes as reward for reaching the next level.

Festive offer
Their successes have also led to neighbours Pakistan helping in the preparations for the Division three tournament in Argentina.

At a recent four week-training camp in Lahore,organised by the Asian Cricket Council,Shoaib Akhtar,Aamir Sohail,Rashid Latif,Ijaz Ahmed and Aaqib Javed passed on crucial tips.

“We discussed a lot of cricket,” Afghanistan batsman Raees Ahmadzai told a cricket website.

“The players look like complete cricketers. We worked a lot on temperament. Our fast bowlers worked on how to control the new ball and our batsmen on how we make partnerships to chase big targets.”

Despite their charge up the world rankings,the troubles at home are never too far away. The Afghanistan cricket academy is based at Kabul’s notorious Ghazi Stadium where the Taliban once staged public executions while in August 2008,Rahmat Wali,who was part of the team from 2001 and 2006,was killed during fighting.

“2011 is a dream – I am very hopeful,” said Afghanistan coach Kabir Ali,a former Pakistan Test player. Despite losing to Afghanistan in the Division Four final in Tanzania last year,Hong Kong were still promoted and their coach,ex-England international Aftab Habib,is confident his side can progress when the action gets underway in Argentina from Saturday.

“It is an achievable dream and it is just a matter of putting in a lot of hard work,” he said of a side who gained valuable experience by playing in the 2008 Asian Cup.

Hosts Argentina and Uganda secured promotion to Division Two in 2007 only to fall straight back down in 2008. “It is going to be a very close tournament and there isn’t going to be much between the teams,” said Argentine coach Hamish Barton.

Like Hong Kong,Uganda have recently tested their ability against a higher-rated nation – Kenya,shock World Cup semi-finalists in 2003. Despite losing two games,at one stage they had their African rivals struggling at 180-8.","Afghanistan's cricket team is competing in the Division Three tournament in Argentina with a chance to qualify for the 2011 World Cup. The team's success in recent ICC tournaments has challenged perceptions about the country and garnered support from neighbors like Pakistan. Despite facing challenges back home, the team is determined to achieve its dream of participating in the World Cup. Afghanistan's cricketing journey, which started outside the ICC just over eight years ago, has seen remarkable progress and earned them respect and support on the international stage.

Forget the so-called ''philosopher''s stone'' which alchemists believe could turn base metal into gold. Forget the perpetual motion machine. The greatest dream of science is cold fusion. Nuclear fusion â€” the opposite of fission â€” takes place when the lighter nuclei in an atom fuse together under intense heat (many millions of degrees Celsius) in a thermonuclear reaction to form a heavier nucleus, in the process releasing a tremendous amount of energy. The sun is a thermonuclear reaction, as is a hydrogen bomb.

Imagine putting a hydrogen bomb in the fuel tank of your car instead of petrol. Or having your own private sun supply all the bijli you''ll ever need. That''s the promise of cold fusion â€” giving humankind an inexhaustible, limitless source of virtually free, non-polluting energy. It would revolutionise the way we live. No more soaring oil prices. No pollution. No petro-funded terrorism. The problem is that cold fusion has largely been dismissed as a chimera â€” a golden goose that can never be.

Cold fusion â€” harnessing nuclear energy without recourse to the humungous temperatures that conventional fusion entails â€” has long been the holy grail of fringe science. Experimenters from Baltimore to Bangalore have claimed success. (The lad from Karnataka said he''d achieved cold fusion in his bathtub). All such claims have been disproved. But many â€” like us â€” believe cold fusion is indeed possible. And will be made to happen, sooner rather than later. So why not in 2005?

Fill Pill

The most in-your-face problem in today''s space-age world is that of brute hunger. How can large parts of the world literally starve in this age of globalisation and electronic connectivity? Can''t we use our hi-tech expertise to create laboratory-synthesised food stuff which would be imperishable, need no cooking (so as to save fuel wood), no cultivation, fertiliser, irrigation.

At one stroke, we could solve the problem of hunger and free the energies and talents of a mass of humankind to pursuits other than foraging for a mere subsistence. A total pipedream? That''s what they said about soya steaks or square tomatoes, which could be better stored in cartons and make neater sandwiches. As a bonus, lab food would be shudh shakahari and relieve us of the guilt of killing animals for the table.

Have a Heart

With stem cell progressing in many parts of the world, it will soon be easier to get new spare parts for your body than for your two-year-old car. Patients in need of a heart transplant, for example, need no longer wait for a deceased donor whose transplanted heart the recipient''s immune system might well reject. In future, those diagnosed as likely to need a cardiac replacement could have a readymade spare in storage, thanks to innovations in stem cell technology. Such transplants would obviate rejection by the host body.

As not just organs, but individual cells, are designer-cloned, diseases so far said to be incurable â€” such as the motor neuron syndrome, from which physicist Stephen Hawking suffers â€” could be successfully treated. Imagine the author of A Brief History of Time getting out of his wheelchair and taking a bow at his next public appearance.

Neo Knowledge

Ever wanted to learn a foreign language? Learn to play the piano, or golf? Know all there is to know about Einstein''s theory? But just never had enough time to do any of these things? Don''t worry. Thanks to computer-human interface technology, we could soon have directly transmitted into us all the physical and mental know-how that we need. Just like Neo in The Matrix, each of us could learn anything â€” from Sanskrit to cordon bleu cooking, from karate to astrophysics â€” merely by plugging ourselves into the relevant program. In the process, we''d liberate childhood from the drudgery of weighty textbooks and piles of homework. Learning? You could, literally, do it in your sleep. Talk about lying down on the job!

Moon in June

Now that plane journeys cost less than train voyages, what''s next? A true apex fare that will take you to the very heights of your travel aspirations and send you into space. Way out? Not at all. A few billionaires have already shelled out large sums to be the world''s first space tourists. It''s been historically proven that any product or service that starts off as an extravagance for the wealthy eventually becomes as everyday as sliced bread. So too will space trips. In fact, Richard Branson, who gave you eminently affordable fares on his airline, is already exploring ''Virgin'' territory in space.

HIV Negative

The time has not just come for the AIDS vaccine, it''s long overdue. Field tests have already begun in many parts of the world, including India. Indeed, the Indian pharma industry has already supplied bulk anti-AIDS drugs to Africa at cut-price rates. A truly effective preventive could well be available before this year is out. And then, maybe, we could try and develop an anti-flu serum. And that''s not a joke. In 1918, a flu epidemic â€” the worst outbreak of infectious disease in history â€” killed up to 50 million people worldwide.

Zurich on Jhelum

Solve the Kashmir problem by turning it into Zurich on the Jhelum. Make Srinagar into a corporate haven-cum-tax and finance shelter, promising utmost discretion in all dealings. Like Switzerland, Kashmir could be permanent host to international organisations like UNESCO and UNICEF, besides being the venue for hush-hush contacts to solve controversial issues, such as the Maoist problem in Nepal.

From a zone of conflict to zone of conflict resolution. Switzerland survived two world wars and two predatory dictators, Hitler and Stalin, who allowed it to maintain its neutrality. Why? Because it was in everyone''s interest to keep Switzerland as a safe conduit for money and confidential international diplomacy. Today, in the Asian century of the new millennium, Europe is old hat, and an eastern Switzerland is awaited. What better choice than a Kashmir, which under international mandate, replaces the obsolete Helvetic Republic?

Ghoos Golis

Does corruption make you sick to the stomach? Try not to be. The solution is to get the person who is corrupt sick to his stomach. If corruption has become an endemic disease, let''s treat it as such. A pathological addiction like alcohol or smoking, both of which are treated by medication which makes the patient physically nauseous if he tries to break the regimen he is on. In the near future, the anti-ghoos golis would be a necessary prescription for all holders of public office, from beat policemen to political netas. The moment any of them even thought of taking a bribe â€” much less actually accepting one â€” he''d be overcome with a physical reaction which would deter all cupidity.

Shrink Wrap

Live off the fat of the land, yet be as thin as a steak. How? Body science is all set to invent a form-hugging inner garment which you''ll wear under your normal clothes, which will mould you into any shape your heat desires. Acting as a wearable super-sauna, it will painlessly melt off flab and inches, and leave you with an abs-olutely flat tum. Excess inches could be strategically relocated â€” from the gluteus maximus to biceps and delts in the case of men. And women, of course, could go for bust. Goodbye, sadistic gym instructors and that maxim, ''no pain, no gain''. Arnold, eat your heat out. And you too, Pamela Anderson.

Beta Yourself

Why have piece of mind when you can have peace of mind all the time? All our negative feelings of frustration, hostility, anger come from the spiky alpha wave in the brain function. The gentler beta wave brings meditative peace and tranquillity, a feeling of oneness with all that is around you, including your fellow human beings. We already have cardiac pacemakers to monitor our heartbeats. Why not a similar implant to regulate our brain waves? At one stroke, we would eliminate all violence â€” in the world and within ourselves. And what about those scofflaws to refuse to beta themselves? Simple, we''d have a beta gun, ready for use. Zap! Join me in nirvana.

Run, Sachin, Run

The little master, and millions of his fans, may have been disappointed when he missed out on his 35th ton against Bangladesh. But perhaps that was just as well. There has been enough snickering about the quality of the opposition against which he got his 34th, to tie Sunil Gavaskar. The 35th deserves an appropriate setting, against formidable opposition.

As RIM (Research In Motion) launches the BlackBerry 10 (BB10), the smartphone from its stable, in Mumbai today, we in the city have much reason to cheer. It is a proud moment for students and engineers working in the tech-business incubators at the Startup Village in Kalamassery for they have developed more than 200 apps for the BB10World app market. These youngsters are thrilled.

Twenty-one-year-old Arvind Sanjeev’s app, RideSmart, has received an appreciation from BlackBerry and he is all set to be part of the launch. He has been invited for the event to showcase the possibilities of controlling the car using his app that facilitates remote vehicle activation using smartphones.

With the RideSmart one can switch on the car, control the features like AC, parking lights, central locking, engine start, power windows and many other activities. “It has a futuristic scope of even controlling your car via the smartphone,” says Arvind. The app needs a small hardware module to be fitted in the car.

Arun Ravi K., 23, and Ramchand B.R., 23, who represent Agrima Infotech Pvt Ltd., are from a group of seven engineering students who are the developers of ‘India’s first Humanoid Robot with Artificial Intelligence’. Their app VIKI is a personal assistant exclusive for BlackBerry phones. Information like real time news, weather forecasts, current movies, live scores, conversation etc. will be served to the users via this application. “The main attraction is that the users can have a conversation with their phone,” say Arun and Ram, adding that VIKI responds after studying client behaviour. “VIKI is not something but someone,” they say proudly.

It was in May last year that BlackBerry set up Rubus Labs, BB’s first innovation zone, in Asia-Pacific, at the Startup Village, to enable youngsters create basic apps and market them. Through live Webinars and seminars they encouraged and guided youngsters to actively be a part of the process of developing the BB10. Six months ago they provided developer devices at Rubus to those who were interested in making apps. “This gave them the advantage. Blackberry also arranged for hackathons and workshops in Kerala. At a hackathon in Bangalore students from the Startup Village came up trumps winning the first prize,” says Zacharias Manuel, Knowledge Architect of Startup Village declaring with pride that the average age of the techies is below 30.

BASE Kerala (Blackberry App Student Entrepreneur) was another collaborative between Blackberry and Startup Village which was run across five engineering colleges in the State that threw up student developers. “Our company Profundis has developed 12 simple apps for BB10,” say Jofin Joseph and Sachin Mathew disclosing that the brief from BB was to open up the phone from being just a business phone to a wider market including students and homemakers. Hence their apps Yoga, Make-a-Drink and the likes are conducive for all users. Recently, their company, which is mainly into Date Analysis has got selected for Microsoft Accelerator Programme, the first company from Kerala.

Rohil Dev, 22 of RHL Vision swipes his hand casually over his developer device and turns on the music. He casually runs it back and forth and changes the tracks. His app, Ferne Player, a trackless music player enables the pause, stop, play features by a simple hand movement.

Arun Chandran and Ratheesh VR started Ovoid, an independent video game development company. Their prime focus is on gaming and they have made Ikebana, a puzzle game for the smartphone.

The Movie Tarot, an app made by riafy, a team of six developers, “quantifies hype” over a film and predict its box office rating, explains John Mathew, Benoy Joseph and Joseph Babu. They claim to have had considerable success, at the trial stage, with their app, having used it to predict box-office rating for some of the recently released films like Talaash , Vishwaroopam and Kai Po Che .

Annie Mathew, Director, Alliances and Business Development, RIM, states that the biggest contribution by these ‘Blackberry Boys’ is innovation, on how the consumer engages with the BB, of how the phone is used to manage systems. The other thing she foresees is “the creation in large numbers of locally relevant applications because you have Malayalis making apps for Malayalis. They understand the need so it becomes more personal.” Meanwhile, the young men for whom it has been a “big learning experience,” wait eagerly for the response to their applications from the Indian market, already having got good feedback from markets in Canada and America.","In Mumbai, Research In Motion (RIM) launches the BlackBerry 10 (BB10) smartphone, a proud moment for students and engineers from the tech-business incubators at the Startup Village in Kalamassery.

Successfully executed assigned tasks, Operation Sindoor still ongoing: IAF

The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Sunday said it has successfully executed its assigned tasks in Operation Sindoor with precision and professionalism, and the operation was still ongoing.

In a post on X, the IAF said the operations were conducted in accordance with the national objectives and urged all to refrain from speculation and dissemination of unverified information.
The government on Saturday said India has come to an understanding on the ceasefire and paused military action. Hours after India and Pakistan reached an understanding, Pakistani drones were sighted and intercepted in various locations. India said Pakistan violated the ceasefire, adding that the armed forces were giving an “adequate and appropriate response”.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, in a late-night press briefing on Saturday, said the armed forces were maintaining a strong vigil on the situation and have been given strict instructions to deal strongly with any repetition of border violations along the International Border and the LoC.

On Sunday, the IAF said its X post, “The Indian Air Force (IAF) has successfully executed its assigned tasks in Operation Sindoor, with precision and professionalism. Operations were conducted in a deliberate and discreet manner, aligned with National Objectives. Since the Operations are still ongoing, a detailed briefing will be conducted in due course. The IAF urges all to refrain from speculation and dissemination of unverified information.”

The IAF, in tandem with the Army and Navy, carried out the successful mission of destroying nine terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7.

Following the success, Pakistan, in reaction, tried to attack military installations and civilian areas in India. All the attacks were negated, and the Indian Armed Forces retaliated in equal measure.

From the various media briefings done by the government, it has been shared that several airbases in Pakistan have been destroyed in precision retaliation, with care being taken not to cause civilian damage.

Though the Air Force has not shared the exact details of the various attacks that have been carried out in the last few days in retaliation for Pakistan’s drone and missile actions, BJP leader Amit Malviya has shared the details of the places struck.

Malviya shared the list of the bases attacked during Operation Sindoor. He also posted a map highlighting the bases attacked.

1. Nur Khan/Chaklala Airbase (Rawalpindi) — India’s strike on Nur Khan disrupted the heart of Pakistan’s air logistics and high-level military coordination. As the base closest to Islamabad, often used for VIP transport and military logistics, its neutralisation severed critical links between the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) leadership and its operational units during the conflict.

2. PAF Base Rafiqui (Shorkot) — Rafiqui, a key fighter base hosting frontline combat squadrons, was rendered inoperable. The destruction of its aircraft shelters and runway infrastructure significantly weakened Pakistan’s ability to launch counter-air operations, especially in central Punjab. This move effectively removed one of PAF’s sharpest offensive tools.

3. Murid Airbase (Punjab) — By targeting Murid, India disrupted a vital training and potential missile storage hub. The strike degraded Pakistan’s long-term air force readiness, cutting off a critical node in the pilot training pipeline and eliminating logistical depth for future operations.

4. Sukkur Airbase (Sindh) — India’s destruction of Sukkur Airbase cut Pakistan’s southern air corridor. Sukkur had been essential for troop and equipment movement across Sindh and Balochistan. Its loss severed key logistical arteries and reduced Pakistan’s operational range in the south.

5. Sialkot Airbase (Eastern Punjab) — Sialkot, situated close to the Indian border, was neutralised early in the conflict. This base had served as a forward-operating platform for launching sorties toward Jammu and Punjab. Its loss created a significant blind spot along the eastern frontier, exposing Pakistani ground forces to unchallenged Indian aerial dominance.

6. Pasrur Airstrip (Punjab) — Though smaller in scale, the Pasrur facility played a role in dispersal and emergency aircraft operations. By taking it out, India reduced Pakistan’s tactical flexibility and forced aircraft to concentrate at more vulnerable, high-profile locations.

7. Chunian (Radar/Support Installation) — Strikes on Chunian disrupted radar coverage and communications infrastructure vital for central Punjab’s airspace monitoring. This left a gap in Pakistan’s early warning systems, allowing Indian aircraft deeper penetration with reduced risk.

8. Sargodha Airbase (Mushaf Base) — The destruction of Sargodha was a strategic masterstroke. As the most critical base in Pakistan – home to the Combat Commanders School, nuclear delivery platforms, and elite squadrons – its decimation crippled Pakistan’s command-and-control structure. The blow was both operational and symbolic, shattering the myth of an invulnerable PAF.

9. Skardu Airbase (Gilgit-Baltistan) — India’s neutralisation of Skardu degraded Pakistan’s northern surveillance and air operations near the Line of Actual Control. It also disrupted logistical links that could have supported Chinese-Pakistani coordination in the high Himalayas. The strategic advantage in the northern theatre now firmly belongs to India.

10. Bholari Airbase (Near Karachi) — As one of Pakistan’s newest airbases with dual-use naval and air roles, Bholari had symbolised future ambitions of southern force projection. Its destruction erased those aspirations, compromising coastal defence coordination and leaving Karachi vulnerable to further strikes.

11. Jacobabad Airbase (Sindh-Balochistan) — Jacobabad’s neutralisation further isolated western Pakistan. Historically used for rapid troop deployment and even by US forces during the war on terror, its destruction cut off internal mobility, supply chains, and Pakistan’s western air surveillance.
","The Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed on Sunday that it has successfully carried out its assigned missions under Operation Sindoor with “precision and professionalism,” even as the operation remains ongoing. The IAF emphasized that the operations aligned with national objectives and cautioned against speculation or spreading unverified information. Operation Sindoor was launched in response to Pakistan’s violations of a recent ceasefire understanding, including drone incursions. The IAF, in coordination with the Army and Navy, reportedly targeted and destroyed 11 key Pakistani airbases and strategic installations, including Sargodha, Nur Khan, Skardu, and Jacobabad. These strikes disrupted Pakistan’s logistics, air capabilities, and command infrastructure. While official military details remain limited, BJP leader Amit Malviya shared locations and strategic insights about the attacked sites, underscoring India's intention to disable Pakistan’s air power without causing civilian harm. India maintains that any provocation will be met with “adequate and appropriate” response. A detailed briefing from the IAF is expected once operations conclude."
c6594bbef94b3aa82283f177f3bce829,"[DOC 1] The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Friday announced the dates for the upcoming assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana. However, the much-anticipated announcement for the Maharashtra assembly elections has been deferred. This decision marks a departure from the previous election cycle, where Maharashtra and Haryana held their assembly polls simultaneously.

Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, during a press conference, explained the rationale behind this decision. He cited security concerns in Jammu and Kashmir as a primary reason for the delay in announcing the Maharashtra polls. The security requirements for the J&K elections necessitate careful allocation of resources, making it challenging to manage multiple elections simultaneously.


Additionally, Kumar pointed out that Maharashtra is currently experiencing delays in updating its voter list due to the ongoing monsoon season. The state is also in the midst of significant cultural and religious observances, including Pitru Paksha, Diwali, and Ganesh Chaturthi, which would complicate the electoral process if polls were to be held immediately.

Kumar reassured that the ECI has the flexibility to schedule elections up to six months before the Legislative Assembly’s term ends, allowing them to choose a more suitable time for the Maharashtra elections once all necessary preparations are complete.

In response to the deferment, Aaditya Thackeray, leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT) faction, criticised both the Election Commission and the Union government. He accused the ECI of succumbing to political pressure and questioned the Union government’s claims of improved security in Jammu and Kashmir. Thackeray alleged that the delay in Maharashtra’s elections was an attempt to give the ruling party more time to prepare, asserting that the people of Maharashtra had already rejected the current administration once and would do so again.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced the dates for the upcoming assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana, but the Maharashtra assembly elections have been deferred.

At about 22:30 hours on the 3rd of October 2023, the South Lhonak glacial lake in North Sikkim breached its banks and flooded the Teesta basin. The floodwaters raged down the river towards the Teesta III dam at Chungthang, the largest dam on the Teesta. Unfortunately due to a lack of early warning, the dam workers were informed too late and despite their desperate heroic attempts to open the reservoir gates to let out the 5.08 million cubic meters of water stored in the dam, they were unable to open the gates and the flood waters hit the reservoir with such explosive force that the dam completely gave away and the floodwaters added even more volume and velocity by carrying away all the water from the dam. This amplified the natural disaster giving it tremendous power as the flood raced towards the low lying areas further south - wiping out 14 bridges, miles of highways, destroying or damaging hundreds of properties and killing over a hundred people along the way.
This was one of the biggest disasters Sikkim has ever faced and it will take the state years to recover and rebuild from this. So it is pertinent to question what went wrong and how can we further prevent such disasters from taking place?
Respecting Geography
Sikkim is situated in one of the most beautiful regions of the world - the Greater Himalayas - filled with breathtaking snow clad mountains, steep verdant hills, gushing snow fed rivers and innumerable serene lakes. But its beauty hides the history behind its formation- a terrible clash between the Indian and Asian plates around 50 million years ago which went to create today's awe-inspiring landscape. Because this region lies in the fault lines between these two plates, it is a seismic hot zone prone to massive earthquakes every couple of decades. Also since this region is the youngest in the world, the soils are highly unstable and prone to landslides. The entire region is still stabilizing and subsisting by about .18cm a year. So the geography of the region is highly fragile.
Challenges of Global Warming
In the past few decades, the entire global climate is rapidly heating up - wreaking havoc on climate systems and the environment. This is particularly true for the Himalayan belt. While the rest of the world is heating up at a rate of .29 degrees per year, the Himalayas are heating up at around 1 degree per year. This is causing rapid melting of the glaciers which are retreating at an alarming rate - leading to the formation of huge glacial lakes at very high altitudes. The melting of glaciers has two major implications for the region - the threat of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) like the one we just experienced, which can cause huge devastation and loss of life and property and the water flow in our rivers. As the glaciers melt, they add more and more water to the rivers but eventually if the glaciers melt completely- the rivers will also dry up. This will have a huge impact on our agriculture, water supply and our economy. Global warming has also had a huge impact on the traditional rainfall patterns with unpredictable cloudbursts and downpours and unseasonal rain. The last decade's precipitation data shows that pre and post monsoon rainfall is increasing every year while monsoon rainfall is decreasing which will also change the traditional seasonal water levels in the rivers. Thus any hydropower projects being built on such unstable rivers with unpredictable water flow need to undertake serious study to see how feasible they will be long term. Dams are huge investment projects and need to be feasible for hundreds of years to be profitable. If they cannot survive 10/15 years due to flash floods or unstable water levels, does it make sense to build them? This is a conversation that the Govt. needs to have with the scientific community and to do a deep analysis before committing so much public money into any hydropower projects in the future.
Eco-sensitive Development
While this particular disaster has woken the people of Sikkim about the dangers of dams on unstable rivers, yet there are other areas of development in the state that are still not a subject of public discussion and debate. There are huge construction projects coming up all around the state - from multiple universities, religious and tourism related projects, malls, multi- storied parking plazas, multi-storied housing complexes, hotels and many more. All coming up in a region that is a seismic hotspot and also one that is rapidly subsisting and a landslide red zone. In such a region - we cannot ponder if a natural disaster will happen but prepare for when it strikes. Because disasters are bound to happen given our geographical status. So establishing early warning systems, robust disaster management systems and spreading public awareness on dealing with natural disasters is the need of the hour. Also given that we are in such a geographical hotspot, every big project needs to be assessed by the scientific community and then put before the public for consultation before being implemented. If we continue to ignore our environment and continue on this path of rampant unheeded development then we have to be prepared to face many such calamities in the future.","The article discusses the catastrophic consequences of the South Lhonak glacial lake in North Sikkim breaching its banks, causing immense flooding downstream towards the Teesta III dam. Due to the lack of early warnings, heroic attempts by dam workers failed to prevent the dam's collapse, resulting in extensive destruction, including the loss of lives, bridges, highways, and properties. It highlights Sikkim's geographical vulnerability due to seismic activity, unstable soils, and the accelerated impact of global warming on glacier melting, leading to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and altering river water flow. The piece stresses the necessity of reevaluating the feasibility of hydropower projects, emphasizing the importance of eco-sensitive development, early warning systems, robust disaster management, and public awareness to mitigate future calamities in the region."

The first entry in this list tries to jump that hurdle and makes a valiant attempt to explain how economics shapes our world. In Edible Economics: A Hungry Economist Explains the World (Allen Lane, Rs 999), Ha-Joon Chang, professor at the University of Cambridge, makes economics “more palatable by serving it with stories about food”. Each chapter, titled after a different food item, helps the author illustrate a salient aspect of everyday economics. For instance, Chapter 8 is titled “Beef: in which the most controversial meat reveals how free trade doesn’t mean freedom for all”. Or, Chapter 10 on Coca-Cola “in which a drink that resembles an ageing rock band tells us why so many developing countries are unhappy with the prevailing economic ideology”. The second book of note in 2022 is Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology (Simon & Schuster, Rs 799) by Chris Miller, who teaches international history at Tufts University’s Fletcher School. Microchips (or semiconductors) are central to the functioning of just about anything one uses these days. The book is essentially a history of this “critical technology” and explains why the two biggest economies (and powers) of the world — the US and China — are locked in an increasingly heated conflict over its production and development. ","In ""Edible Economics: A Hungry Economist Explains the World"" by Ha-Joon Chang, economics is made more accessible through food analogies, with each chapter using a different food item to illustrate key economic concepts.

The book aims to demystify economics and show its relevance to everyday life. 

Meanwhile, ""Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology"" by Chris Miller delves into the history and significance of microchips, which are essential components in modern technology. Miller, a professor of international history, explores the intensifying rivalry between the US and China over microchip production and development, highlighting the geopolitical implications of this technological competition.

c42f5369dab9d579a5921480cfaad6f2,"[DOC 1] Hassan Nasrallah, the former Secretary-General of Hezbollah, has long been the embodiment of radical ideology, merging intense anti-Israel sentiments with theological hostility toward Jews. His rhetoric, often cloaked in religious language, was not simply political opposition but a worldview disturbingly akin to Adolf Hitler’s antisemitic doctrines. Like Hitler, Nasrallah viewed Jews as an evil force, dehumanizing them and calling for their annihilation as both a political and existential mission.

For decades, Nasrallah acted as a key figure within Iran’s network of proxies across the Middle East, serving as a mouthpiece for Tehran’s anti-Israel agenda. Under his leadership, Hezbollah operated as both a political entity in Lebanon and a militant group, engaging in terrorism aimed at Israel and Western interests. However, Nasrallah’s animosity was not limited to Israelis alone; it was rooted in broader antisemitism, portraying Jews as inherently evil and deserving of divine punishment.

Nasrallah’s infamous 2002 speech in Beirut epitomized his apocalyptic vision concerning Israel and the Jewish people. His words echoed the genocidal ideology of the Nazis, demonizing Jews and justifying their destruction. “The Jews have gathered in one place,” he remarked, suggesting that Israel’s establishment was part of a divinely orchestrated plan for their final annihilation. This rhetoric mirrored the logic of Hitler’s Final Solution, positioning Jews as a cosmic enemy that must be eradicated.

By invoking Islamic prophecy and political opportunism, Nasrallah cast every violent act against Israel as divinely sanctioned. His statements blurred the lines between political conflict and religious war, deepening regional instability and fueling a worldview in which the eradication of Jews was seen as an apocalyptic necessity.

Nasrallah’s hatred extended beyond Israel’s borders. In a speech during the Shia festival of Ashura, he proclaimed, “If we searched the entire world for a person more cowardly, despicable, weak, and feeble in psyche, mind, ideology, and religion, we would not find anyone like the Jew. Notice, I do not say the Israeli.” This distinction revealed his true agenda: enmity not only towards Israel as a state but towards Jews globally. It was this dehumanization, divorced from political context, that made Nasrallah’s ideology disturbingly similar to Hitler’s.

Like Hitler, who depicted Jews as an existential threat to humanity, Nasrallah left no room for dialogue or coexistence. His worldview justified violence as a means to an apocalyptic end, in which Jews were portrayed as inherently corrupt. His speeches fueled extremist violence across the region, turning political conflict into a religious war with genocidal overtones.

Nasrallah’s position was shaped by his close ties with Iran, whose leadership had repeatedly called for Israel’s destruction. Under Tehran’s influence, Hezbollah became both a military proxy and a propagator of antisemitic ideology. Iran’s apocalyptic vision, tied to the return of the Mahdi, aligned with Nasrallah’s portrayal of the Jewish state as temporary, destined to fall in a climactic battle.

Nasrallah’s dangerous views extended far beyond the Middle East. His sermons resonated with Islamist extremists worldwide, providing theological justification for antisemitism and terrorism. His portrayal of Jews as the ultimate enemy of Islam made him a global symbol of religious extremism, emboldening terrorist groups that saw his rhetoric as a call to action.

The international community long recognized that Nasrallah’s words were not mere political posturing but a call to genocide. His dehumanization of Jews paralleled the darkest chapters of human history, particularly Hitler’s genocidal ideology. Nasrallah’s influence, backed by Hezbollah’s militant activities, represented a constant threat to global peace and security.

Today, with Nasrallah’s death, the world reflects on the legacy of his extremist ideology. His worldview, steeped in hatred and violence, was a modern manifestation of the Hitlerian mindset. He leaves behind a dangerous legacy, one that underscores the need for global vigilance against ideologies that seek to destroy entire populations under the guise of religion and politics. Nasrallah’s vision was not just a threat to Israel but to the very fabric of humanity itself.","Hassan Nasrallah, former Secretary-General of Hezbollah, was a key figure in Iran's anti-Israel agenda, presenting Jews as evil and deserving of divine punishment.

da523d6c476d82aaecd6aab14e5b3d45,"[DOC 1] The share of people under 30, popularly referred to as GenZ, has nearly doubled compared to other age groups in terms of number of investors on India’s premier stock exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE).

Data from a May report of the NSE showed that the GenZ, which had a share of around 22-23% of the exchange’s users in FY19 (before the pandemic), now comprises 40.1% of the NSE’s 95 million registered investor base as of May 2024.

Incidentally, this group has also been the biggest age-group on the NSE over the past three years, taking pole position in terms of number of users across age groups in FY22 (see table).

Nisarg Seth, a 28-year-old trader, said what motivates him to trade is that the job requires more of analytical skills, rather than labour work, or simply buying or selling a commodity. “I’ve also been seeing big names in the industry like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Vijay Kedia, who started their trading journey at a very early stage and made big money,” he said.

Market veterans say the lure for this age group has been index options and speculative activity on the cash market.

“The below-30 age group comprises those who are in for a quick buck, rather than tapping the market for serious investing,” said Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO of HDFC Securities. “Options and intraday squaring off in the cash market are what attracts them. They are those who’ve just completed their education or those just started their working careers and, thus, prefer cheaper instruments like options.”

Intraday squaring off means taking positions on stocks between market hours. If a position is not closed before end of trading at 3:30 pm, delivery has to be given or taken.

The rise of this investor group coincides with NSE’s premium turnover of index options—the most popular traded product—surging 426% from ₹26.29 trillion in FY21 to ₹138.19 trillion in FY24.

The tally for the current fiscal through 2 July stands at ₹40 trillion. Cash market turnover on NSE has risen at a more sedate 30% from ₹154 trillion in FY21 to ₹201 trillion in FY24. The tally for the fiscal through 2 July (FY25) stands at ₹76.32 trillion.

The fact of the younger generation entering the markets is proven by the age of the median investor on Groww, the country’s biggest brokerage by clients, being 29, said a company spokesperson.

“Mostly, GenZ is in the market for speculative activity,” said Anand K. Rathi, co-founder of MIRA Money, a Bangalore-based mutual fund investment platform. “They are into buying options based more on hearsay rather than on taking informed decisions. They take loans from friends and family to trade.”

Asked about the count of such investors increasing with investor penetration being a fraction of the population, Rathi said in the long term the count would stabilise as those losing money would be replaced by other “newbies”.

“There is no homogeneity in GenZ; some among them are smart investors doing outstanding research,” Nilesh Shah, MD of Kotak Mahindra AMC remarked. “Unfortunately, many others are traders trying their luck rather than using their skill.”

The share of the under-30 age group began steadily rising post FY21, a year after the pandemic surfaced. GenZ overtook those between the 30 and 39 age group (millennial), with their share in the total registered investor base increasing from 29.4% in FY21 to 40.1% as on 31 May, as per NSE data.

Those between 30 and 39 saw their share decrease marginally from 30.4% to 29.2% over the same period. Other age groups also saw their share fall over the same period (see table).

Thanks to this decline in the other age groups, exchange data shows that the age of the median investor has dropped from 38 years in FY18 to 32 years currently. Similarly, the average age of the investor has dropped from 41 years to 36 years.

Interestingly, the maximum number of registered investors on NSE in the current fiscal through 31 May came from North India (33.8 million), followed by west (29.4 million), south (19.6 million) and east India at 11.2 million. Others, mainly army personnel, accounted for 0.9 million, for whom state mapping is unavailable, as per the data.","GenZ investors on India's NSE have nearly doubled since FY19, now comprising 40.1% of the exchange's 95 million users. This group, driven by index options and speculative trading, has led NSE investor growth for three years. Market veterans note their focus on quick profits over long-term investment. The rise coincides with a surge in index options turnover. The median investor age has dropped from 38 to 32. While some GenZ investors are skilled, many engage in risky, hearsay-driven trading. The majority of NSE investors are from North and West India."
073dfc7088dbd8bd9b47f7fac973af27,"[DOC 1] NEW DELHI: The operation to drop arms in Purulia in 1995 was approved by the Indian government and was for
arming people against 'oppression' by the CPM government in West Bengal, the kingpin of the mysterious
operation Kim Davy has claimed.Speaking to Times Now, Davy said, ""Central government saw and approved the
plans to arm the defence of these innocent people."" He claimed that the consignment was meant to arm the
people of Purulia against violent oppression by CPM cadres in West Bengal.
Niels Christian Nielsen, aka Kim Peter Davy, a citizen of Denmark, is presently fighting his extradition to India in
the case. In 1995, he and his accomplices chartered a Latvian aircraft and flew from Pakistan to Purulia, dropping
a huge cache of weapons.
Reacting to Davy's claims, CPM demanded that the central government explain the mysterious arms drop. The
party's politburo said in a statement that the ""latest revelations on the arms drop in Purulia in West Bengal in
December 1995 are further confirmation of the fact that there was a well-planned conspiracy to use violence to
destabilize the Left Front at that time"".
CPM said, ""Whatever has been said by Kim Davy, a prime accused in the case, and Peter Bleach, who was
sentenced in the case, show that the arms drop for the Ananda Margis was planned through an international
network and the target was the Left Front government. It was known at that time that the British intelligence
had alerted the Indian government about the arms drop. Yet, the central government failed to inform the West
Bengal government about the matter in time.""
In the interview to the TV channel, Davy claimed, ""RAW was informed by external forces and approved of the
arms drop months in advance."" He also asserted that the external intelligence agency had ensured that the Air
Force's radar in the area was switched off so that the aircraft was not picked up when it flew in to drop the arms.
""Of course there were Indians involved. There were political forces at the centre"" supporting the arms drop, he
said. PV Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister of the Congress-led government at the Centre in 1995.
Davy also claimed that there was communication ""between the British intelligence MI5 and RAW"" and that there
was ""a British ex-intelligence officer on board the plane"" that dropped the arms. But there was no American
involvement, he added. ""The Indian authorities knew the flight plan, the people on board, the cargo, the drop
zone -- everything was known well in advance and approved well in advance,"" Davy claimed.
Davy also said it was a ""matter of public record that RAW was informed on three defined dates by MI5 about the
arms drop, the people on board the plane, the drop zone, everything"". He asked who ""in their right mind would fly
a plane from the arch enemy of Pakistan into Indian airspace with a load of clandestine weapons without having
it cleared by with the Indian authorities.""
Without naming anyone, Davy claimed he was in ""direct contact with an MP who told me that he was in further
contact with the Prime Minister's Office""","In 1995, Kim Davy, the mastermind behind the mysterious arms drop in Purulia, claimed that the Indian government had approved the operation to arm people against what he described as 'oppression' by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) government in West Bengal. Davy asserted that the consignment was intended to help the people of Purulia defend themselves against violence from CPM cadres. He further alleged that the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was informed and approved the arms drop well in advance, indicating involvement from political forces at the center, during the tenure of Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) demanded an explanation from the central government regarding the arms drop. The CPM politburo stated that Davy's revelations confirmed a well-planned conspiracy to destabilize the Left Front government in West Bengal. Davy claimed that there was communication between British intelligence MI5 and RAW, with a British ex-intelligence officer reportedly on the plane during the arms drop. He asserted that Indian authorities were aware of the flight plan, people on board, cargo, and drop zone in advance.

Davy's allegations raise questions about the role of RAW, political forces, and international connections in the controversial arms drop, prompting demands for a thorough investigation and clarification from the central government."

Calcutta | Published 16.02.24, 06:04 AM
The battle lines are drawn. For the city’s fiercest war of words. Over the country’s supreme book of law.

On Saturday evening, on the lawns of Calcutta Club, eight panellists will debate whether India’s Constitution has outlived itself.

The motion of the Sister Nivedita University presents Calcutta Club The Telegraph National Debate 2024: This house believes India does not need a new Constitution.

A highlight of the evening would be a keynote address by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Her third tryst with this stage comes after 13 years.

In 2009, she had called out the incumbent CPM-led government for not granting autonomy to the (then) Presidency College. She was railing against the motion of the debate — a resurgent Bengal is an impossible dream.

In 2011, months before ousting the Left Front government and storming to power, she opposed the motion that “India will be better run if politicians are left out of the government”.

Unlike her previous appearances, she will not take part in the debate this time.

The ones who will also make a formidable line-up.

The debaters on Saturday will be Retd. Justice Sanjib Banerjee; Sugata Bose, historian and grand-nephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose; Vikramjit Banerjee, additional solicitor-general of India; Arghya Sengupta, founder and research director of Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy; former Tripura and Meghalaya governor Tathagata Roy; Congress leader Alka Lamba; Roopen Roy, CEO and founder of Sumantrana, a strategy consulting firm for start-ups; and Left-leaning economist and activist Prasenjit Bose.

A section of the Right wing claims the Constitution is a colonial legacy.

The Preamble to the Constitution, a reflection of its core values, declares India to be a “Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic”.

Besides a long stint at Calcutta High Court, Justice Banerjee has served as the chief justice of Madras High Court. He retired as the chief justice of Meghalaya High Court in November 2023.

As the chief justice of Madras High Court in April 2021, he had said “murder charges” should be slapped on the poll panel authorities for violation of Covid protocols during the Tamil Nadu Assembly election.

His transfer to the smaller Meghalaya High Court in November 2021 had triggered protests from lawyers at Madras High Court.

Sugata Bose, Gardiner professor of oceanic history and affairs at Harvard University and a former parliamentarian, is a staunch critic of the Narendra Modi government.

“The role of the State in the January 22 spectacle is the most decisive step
yet in recasting the Indian republic in a religious majoritarian mould,” he had told this newspaper, referring to inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

As one of the top legal officers in the country, Vikramjit Banerjee is part of the corridors of power in Delhi.

Arghya Sengupta, a Calcutta boy and a columnist for The Telegraph, leads one of the most prominent independent think tanks doing legal research.

Tathagata Roy, a former state BJP chief, is not one to hold back, even if it is about his own team. After the BJP lost the 2021 Bengal election and the 2022 civic polls, his tirade against the state unit and some of the leaders sent from Delhi to lead the poll battles embarrassed some in the party.

Alka Lamba heads the women’s wing of the Congress. A former MLA from Delhi, she has 871K followers on X (formerly Twitter).

Roopen Roy is a former managing director of Deloitte Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers in India.

Prasenjit Bose is a convener of the Joint Forum Against NRC, which had organised a sustained campaign against the Centre’s citizenship thrust.

Neurosurgeon and avid debater Sandip Chatterjee will be the moderator.","The Calcutta Club will host the Calcutta Club The Telegraph National Debate 2024 on Saturday, debating whether India needs a new Constitution.

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland says Monday’s vote triggers a long-standing congressional restriction on funding to U.N. bodies that recognise Palestine as a state before an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal is reached.

","The Obama administration has decided to halt funding to the United Nations cultural agency following its approval of a Palestinian bid for full membership. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland announced on Monday that the vote in favor of Palestine triggers a longstanding congressional restriction on funding to U.N. bodies that recognize Palestine as a state prior to the establishment of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. This decision underscores the U.S. stance of supporting Israel and maintaining a policy of not recognizing Palestinian statehood until a mutually agreed-upon resolution is achieved through negotiations. By cutting off funding to the U.N. cultural agency, the Obama administration aims to uphold this policy and express its disapproval of unilateral actions taken by the Palestinians in international forums without Israeli consent."

Addressing reporters here on Thursday, the union informed that the case was handed over to the SIT on 27 April, adding that, even after 11 months of Taying’s death, his “brutal murder remains a mystery as police failed to make any progress in the case and is still clueless about the perpetrators”.
Expressing disappointment over inordinate delay in cracking the case, AESDSU convenor Yon Taki stated that no advancement has been made on Taying’s case by the police despite the assurance of the Capital Complex superintendent of police to solve it within six month’s time.


Yon also lamented that “the police did not care to inform the family or the union” that the case has been passed on to the SIT.
AESDSU president Oyin Yosung questioned the way the police is handling the case, saying that the police should have looked at every possible angle to nab the culprit.
Referring to the murder case of cashier Bomge Nyori in Mebo, which was solved by the Pasighat unit police within 19 days despite lack of clues initially, Oyin suggested that capital police “learn some lessons” from the police team of Pasighat.
Union general secretary, Tonong Darang opined that the capital police should have also carefully verified the mobile data and all call records of the area from where late Taying’s body was found.
“This might help in zeroing down the suspect’s mobile number from the location during the period when the murder was executed,” he opined.
Affirming to continuously chase the police till justice is delivered, the union also pleaded to the state government to understand the agony of the bereaved family members, especially late Taying’s mother who is reportedly still under trauma and awaiting justice for her son.
Ojing Taying was attacked by two unidentified persons on 10 June, 2017 at Niti Vihar in Itanagar and succumbed to his injuries four days later in a hospital in Guwahati.","The All East Siang District Students’ Union (AESDSU) demanded that the murder case of Ojing Taying be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) if the Special Investigation Team (SIT) fails to progress within a month. Despite 11 months passing since Taying's death, the case remains unsolved, with the police showing no breakthrough. AESDSU criticized the police for the delay and lack of communication regarding the case's status. They urged the police to emulate the Pasighat unit's swift resolution of a similar case. The union seeks justice for Taying's family and requests the state government's intervention in the matter."

Days after former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav’s pet lion safari project was shot down, the saras crane (Grus Antigone), located primarily in Yadav’s backyard - Mainpuri-Etawah belt - finds its wings severly clipped.

The high flying ‘Save Saras’ project, has been grounded as suddenly as it was conceived and launched in June last year by the over-zealous forest officials. Deeply embarrassed, they are now busy trying to wipe off all traces before it is too late.
The greatest pointer of the change in the bird’s fortune are governmnt hoardings that sprouted almost overnight during Mulayam Raj. There were 40 plastic sheet hoarding that cost approximately Rs 16,000 each, put up on the highway and other strategic location.

With picture of three cranes they had a smiling Yadav peering down from top right. A humble Virendra Singh, the then state forest minister, kept him company as “nivedak” on the bottom left.


All hoardings, claimed Kaushlendra Singh, member, Wildlife Board, Uttaranchal, have “disappeared simultaneously with the ouster of SP government.","The ""Save Saras"" project in Uttar Pradesh, aimed at preserving the saras crane, has been halted after the pet project of former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was scrapped.

The five high priests through an edict issued on July 10, 2003 had excommunicated Kala Afghana for alleged objectionable contents in his book having ten volumes.

Kala Afghan had arrived India last month and challenged his excommunication . He was reportedly assaulted by few persons in Ludhiana following which he had taken security cover .

Besides, Kala Afghana also questioned over the alleged Brahmanical mythological content of Gurbilas Patshahi 6 "" a book released by SGPC and edited by the Jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti
.
Kala Afghan questioned as to why the bir of Sri Guru Granth Sahib which was kept in the sanctum sanctorum of Golden Temple was revered more than other birâ€™s while all bir''s have equal status , why Palki Sahib was given too much importance that people rush to give it a shoulder and why the Asa di Var, a composition of 24 pauris and 59 sloaks , was recited early morning ? He also raised objection over reciting shabad in various ragaâ€™s and kirtan in Golden Temple.

He said he didnâ€™t consider himself excommunicated because the persons who had announced his excommunication were not authorized to do so.

Ragarding the alleged objectionable content of his book which led to his excommunication, Kala Afghana said he had time and again sought directions and advise from various Jathedarâ€™s including Vedanti, former Jathedarâ€™s Prof. Manjit Singh , Giani Kewal Singh and Manjit Singh Caluctta but no one replied him or raised any objection then.

He offered a debate with Vedanti and others who have objections over his writings at Gurdwara Manji Sahib or any other place but in the presence of sangat and media .

Besides Gurbax Singh, his son Kanwarjit Singh, grand sons Inderbir Singh and Amandeep Singh and admirers Mohanjit Singh, G.S.Sandhu, Bupinder Singh etc. were present on the occasion. Indebir Singh said that Gurmat Parchar Sabha, Tarn Taran have decided to honour Kala Afghana for his contributions in the Sikh religion.

Notably , the five high priests in the edict have also directed the Sikh sangat to not extend any cooperation to Gurbax Singh or let him or his supporters speak from any Sikh stage.","Gurbax Singh Kala Afghana, a Canada-based excommunicated Sikh author, has challenged his excommunication by the five high priests of the Golden Temple, alleging assault in Ludhiana and seeking security.

Afghana disputed the authority of those who excommunicated him and offered to debate his objections publicly.

The front line fleet of 49 fighters,some of which are also assigned a nuclear delivery role,have been on the ground for the past ten days and will only fly after further safety checks.The entire fleet was grounded after the recent crash on March 5 in Rajasthan when a trainer version of the aircraft went down after the engine cut off in mid flight. The crash was similar to the one that took place last month when another trainer version of the Mirage 2000 went down even as an Air Marshal who was at the controls managed to eject safely.Sources said that a team from Snecma,the engine manufacturers of the French fighters,is presently in India to help the IAF team in its investigation. The two successive crashes have come as a major setback for the IAF that has maintained a very good safety record for the Mirage 2000 fleet with the last crash taking place in 2004.It is learnt that among other lines of investigation,possible defects in the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system that controls the power plant are also being probed. The computer controlled system governs all aspects of engine performance. While this is not a known problem in the fleet,it is being probed as both crashes took place due to engine trouble.Sources said that the fighters will be allowed to fly only after technical checks rule out a larger problem that affects the entire fleet. As reported,in last month’s crash involving Air Marshal Anil Chopra the engine cut off mid flight and did not re engage even after the pilots tried to restart it several times. After successive attempts,both were ordered to eject as the fighter lost altitude.The grounding of the Mirage fleet is the latest in a series of such events that have affected the IAF in the past few years. In February 2010,close to 100 fighters from the MiG 27 fleet were grounded on suspicions of a major engine snag. The Su 30 MKI fleet was also grounded in December 2009 for several days after a HAL made fighter crashed near Pune.You May LikeBrad Pitt delivers a standout performance as the seasoned drifter Sonny Hayes, a role that Cruise would have been miscast in due to his intense persona.

It is understood BCCI will again push for the 'Hybrid Model' like 2023 ODI Asia Cup where India played all its matches, including the ones against Pakistan, in Sri Lanka.
Shah's message, in a way, has put to rest speculations about whether Rohit would quit leadership role in other formats.
Till Rohit calls it quits, India will once again have split captaincy with Rohit leading in ODIs and Tests while Hardik Pandya is expected to take charge of the T20 outfit.Rohit had also led India to the finals of the WTC and ODI World Cup last year, where India lost the summit clash after winning 10 straight games.

""I want to dedicate this victory to coach Rahul Dravid, captain Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja.
""This was our third final in the last year. We lost the WTC final in June, 2023. In November, 2023 we won hearts after 10 wins but couldn't win the Cup.

The Centre imposed a 68-day lockdown, the citizens abided – and the Centre and state governments used that time to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure, stocked up on ventilators, PPE kits, planned and initiated the vaccine drive. By mid February, it seemed that India had weathered the Covid-19 storm with its vaccine program well underway.And then the second Covid-19 wave hit. To say that we as a nation were caught unawares about this second 'Covid Tsunami' will be an understatement. At the government level – both Centre and state - we had dropped the guard. Politicians held mega election rallies, states delayed putting in place curbs that would have prevented spikes in infections, and people like you and me had started partying and vacationing thinking the worst was behind us.Over the last several days, there has been anger and demands that the Centre ensure adequate oxygen supply.

The “Jerry Maguire” actor faces one misdemeanour account of forcible touching in an incident on Sunday when an unidentified woman said Gooding touched her breasts.

Gooding, who denies the accusation, emerged in handcuffs after being charged at a New York police facility. He did not speak to reporters.

He was the latest Hollywood figure to be swept up in a sexual misconduct scandal that has roiled the entertainment industry in the last two years.

Gooding’s attorney, Mark J. Heller, said he was “completely confident that (Gooding) will be totally exonerated.” He told reporters that Gooding will enter a not guilty plea at an initial court appearance.

“There is not a scintilla of criminal culpability that can be attributed to Cuba Gooding Jr.,” Heller told reporters.

Heller said he was “shocked and horrified” that the case was being prosecuted after he presented police with security video from the bar that the attorney said showed no criminal behaviour by Gooding.

Gooding, 51, won a supporting actor Oscar in 1997 for “Jerry Maguire” and had roles in “A Few Good Men,” “The Butler” and the television miniseries “The People v. O.J. Simpson.”

The actor, who is divorced, is one of the dozens of men in politics, entertainment, sports and the business world who have been accused of sexual misconduct since allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein triggered the #MeToo movement.

Weinstein is to stand trial in New York later this year on charges of rape and forced oral sex involving two women. He has denied any non-consensual sex.

Former “House of Cards” actor Kevin Spacey in January pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man at a Massachusetts bar two years ago, while singer R. Kelly was charged in Chicago with sexually assaulting three teens and a woman.

Heller accused the woman who lodged the complaint against Gooding last weekend of seeking “simply to get their 15 minutes of fame” and said he hoped she would herself be prosecuted once Gooding’s case is resolved.

New York media reported on Thursday that another woman had come forward this week alleging inappropriate touching by Gooding in 2008.

Heller said Gooding had “no knowledge” of the alleged 2008 incident, which falls outside the statute of limitations for any potential charges.

2612ee07ed0137ac81961e6bb6f0d9cc,"[DOC 1] As the debate heated up on stricter laws to deal with crime against women, the BJP today reiterated its demand to call a special session of Parliament. The suggestion has not found favour with the Left while the Congress has already rejected it.

A debate in Parliament would “certainly be able to tap upon the serious sense of distress and dismay which is sweeping across the country”, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

He said the BJP would cooperate with the government in fortifying laws relating to crime against women besides strengthening the judicial architecture for ensuring swifter justice to the victims and action against the perpetrators of such heinous crime.

The party had earlier led a delegation to President Pranab Mukherjee urging his intervention in directing the Manmohan Singh government to summon a special session of Parliament. Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde had turned down the suggestion.

Agreeing with the BJP that there was an urgent need to firm up laws dealing with crime against women, CPI MP D Raja said a session could be held, but he doubted its efficacy till the larger issue of gender equality was settled. “The government has not been able to legislate on reservation for women although the Rajya Sabha has already passed the Bill (in March 2010),” Raja said.

BJD leader Bharatruhari Mahtab said unless the government had a specific agenda, there was no point in calling a special session just to debate and discuss. “If the government can come up with a draft legislation to effectively tackle crimes like rape, a special session can be held,” Mahtab said.

Reports suggest that the Congress plans to submit a set of proposals to the Justice Verma Committee set up by the government for suggesting measures to deal with the issue in the wake of the brutal gang rape of 23-year-old Delhi girl who died battling injuries in a Singapore hospital on Saturday.

The BJP today also questioned the move by the authorities in Delhi to block access to public places like the India Gate, the place of violent clashes between police and protesters on December 23. Prasad justified that a “nation in shock” is entitled to protest and criticise the government for converting Delhi into a cantonment.

The BJP also criticised the manner in which the cremation of the rape victim was held. Maintaining that it understands and respects the right of privacy, the BJP leader charged that the secret manner in which the funeral was held raises “a lot of curious questions”.","Amid rising public anger over crimes against women, the BJP urged a special Parliament session to debate stricter laws, a move rejected by Congress and questioned by other parties. The BJP criticized Delhi’s protest restrictions and the secretive cremation of the gang rape victim, calling for transparency and stronger legal reforms.

Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that even though the city’s air quality index (AQI) “improved” to “very poor” zone on Thursday thanks to stronger winds, the situation will likely deteriorate Friday onwards. Through a majority of last week Delhi residents were left gasping for breath as the city was engulfed in a haze of noxious smog – an occurrence that has become a yearly phenomenon in the Capital.

Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that on Thursday, Delhi’s overall AQI was 314, in the “very poor” category. On Wednesday, the AQI was 344, also “very poor”.

Diwali will be celebrated on Saturday.

VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said that winds blowing over Delhi will start slowing down from Friday, and their direction will switch to north-westerly, both factors indicate that the contribution of stubble-burning smoke from Punjab and Haryana in Delhi’s air will increase.

“Even though we have forecast that this Diwali is likely to be better compared to the last few years, the weather is expected to be unfavourable. If people in the city burst crackers, then the pollution level could slip to ‘severe’ on Diwali day and a day after,” Soni said.

The National Green Tribunal on Monday imposed a total ban on the sale and use of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR till November 30 midnight, days after the Delhi government banned all crackers on November 5. ","Weather scientists warn that Delhi’s air quality may worsen into the “severe” category after Diwali due to firecracker violations and stubble burning.

The Central Pollution Control Board reported an AQI of 314 on Thursday, which was “very poor”. The National Green Tribunal and Delhi government have imposed a ban on firecrackers until November 30 to combat this issue."

ba09c9f55f9c50487e3b9c4d0eaf9791,"[DOC 1] In a landmark verdict aimed at insulating the appointment of the chief election commissioner (CEC) and election commissioners (EC) from the executive’s interference, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that their appointments will be done by the president on the advice of a committee comprising the prime minister, the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the chief justice of India.

A five-judge constitution bench headed by Justice KM Joseph, in a unanimous verdict held that this norm will continue to hold good till a law on the issue is made by Parliament.

The apex court said that if the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha is not there, then the leader of the single largest opposition party will be in the committee to appoint the CEC and ECs.

The bench delivered its verdict on a batch of pleas seeking a collegium-like system for the appointment of election commissioners and the CEC.

The bench, also comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar, stressed on purity in the election process, and said that democracy is intrinsically linked to the will of the people.

Justice Rastogi, who concurred with the lead judgment authored by Justice Joseph, delivered a separate verdict with his reasoning.

The apex court said that election in a democracy should be undoubtedly be fair and the buck stops with the election commission to ensure that its purity is maintained.

It said that, in a democracy, the purity of election must be maintained or else it would lead to disastrous consequences.

The bench said the election commission must act within the constitutional framework and within the law and it cannot act in an unfair manner.

It said that an election commission which does not ensure free and fair role in the process, guarantees breakdown of rule of law, which is the bedrock of the democracy.

The bench said that democracy is fragile and would collapse if “lip service” is paid to rule of law.

It referred to Article 324 of the Constitution, which deals with the appointment of members of the election commission, and said that Parliament has not passed any law in this regard as required by the Constitution.

Article 324 (2) says that the election commission consist of the CEC and ECs, if any, as the president may from time to time fix and their appointments shall, subject to the provisions of any law made in that behalf by Parliament, be made by the president.

The apex court had reserved its judgement on the issue on 24 November last year. During the hearing in the matter, the top court had questioned the “haste” and “tearing hurry” with which the Centre had appointed ex-bureaucrat Arun Goel as an election commissioner, saying that his file travelled at “lightning speed” within departments in 24 hours.

The central government had vehemently resisted the observations, with Attorney General R Venkataramani contending that the whole issue pertaining to his appointment needed to be looked at in entirety.

The apex court had asked how the union law minister shortlisted a panel of four names that was recommended to the prime minister for appointment as election commissioner when none of them would have completed the stipulated six-year tenure in office.

It had perused the Centre’s original file on Goel’s appointment, and said, “What kind of evaluation is this, although we are not questioning the merits of Arun Goel’s credentials but the process?” As the bench questioned the “lightning speed” with which Goel was appointed as an EC, Venkataramani, the government’s law officer, had urged the bench not to make observations without looking into the entire issue of the appointment process.

Under the Election Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991, an EC can have a tenure of six years or up to the age of 65, whichever is earlier.

Goel’s appointment as an EC came under scrutiny by the top court, which had sought from the Centre the original records pertaining to his appointment for perusal, saying it wanted to know whether there was any “hanky panky.”

The top court, which had rejected the Centre’s objections to its order for producing the original file, had said it wanted to know whether everything was “hunky dory” in the appointment process as claimed by the government.

On 19 November, Goel, a Punjab cadre IAS officer, was appointed as election commissioner.

Goel would be in line to be the next CEC after incumbent Rajiv Kumar demits office in February 2025. His total tenure in the election commission would be of over five years.

He will join Kumar and Election Commissioner Anup Chandra Pandey on the poll panel.

There was a vacancy in the election commission following the retirement of previous CEC Sushil Chandra in May. Goel was the secretary in the heavy industries ministry and his voluntary retirement came into effect on 18 November last year. He has also served in the union culture ministry.

unlawfully allocated 15 acres of government land in Filmnagar, Hyderabad, to M/s
Red Fort Akbar Properties Private Limited, which is backed by TRS Chevella MP
Ranjit Reddy and Indu Properties Shyamprasad Reddy.

“The market value of this land is about ₹1,500 crores but was given to Red Fort
Akbar Properties Private Limited for just ₹285 crore. Why did the TRS government
agree to alienate expensive land at cheaper price when former Chief Minister of
united Andhra Pradesh Kiran Kumar Reddy kept aside the same deal?” he questioned
at a press conference here. He said Red Fort Akbar Properties Pvt Ltd., a
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of Indu Projects, was allotted 90 acres at
Bachupally by Deccan Infrastructure & Land Holdings Limited (DILL), a subsidiary
of AP Housing Board in 2007, to develop an integrated township. Instead of
paying ₹477 crore at ₹5.30 crore per acre, it had just paid ₹285 crore, he

the entire case was challenged in the court,” he claimed. Mr. Sravan, who also
wrote a letter to Chief Minister K. Chadrasekhar Rao seeking withdrawal of the

The opposition, which includes the president, Congress and university presidents, is demanding the government hand over nearly $4 billion in public funds to buy school snacks by vending machines, ice creams, and free water.

But the demonstration, the largest in Chicago history behind protests in cities like Oakland and Dallas or the Bay Area, had already started to turn violent.

During that span a bomb-wielding man was shot on a street in downtown Chicago over the weekend and a group of students had attacked and injured another on Friday in downtown Chicago. Six students have been charged with felony murder in the stabbing.

At least 20 people went on to burn two banks of Lake Michigan at the scene, according to the Chicago Fire Department.

Some of the protesters tried to escape in a vehicle, but the officers said they thought it was safe to go because Chicago police are looking at possible suspects for the shooting or arson, Chicago Sun-Times reporter Brian Williams said.

The demonstrations began in the early evening and were quickly shut down by security staff as they were being conducted at the request of Chicago's Democratic Party headquarters, the Post-Standard reports. When riot police arrived, they used stun grenades and batons on protesters who were breaking into the building. Protesters hurled stones at officers outside of the building, and a woman who was inside fired three shots at riot police to save their safety.

The police presence at Chicago University, which supports a political organization, turned violent on Saturday when a gunman shot three students, fatally wounding one and wounding the other two at an address as students were leaving classes. A young woman and a 19-year-old man were held on suspicion of attempted homicide, according to the Sun-Sun.

""What we're seeing today is the culmination of more than two days of violent violence, an outpouring of defiance and a violent response,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), an ally of the president, said.

But Emanuel also said in a statement issued on Sunday afternoon, ""We will not back down from the fight to defend the life, the safety and welfare of our young students and the American people. I have received multiple phone calls from children, parents and teachers here and across this country where our children have been shaken by these events and they will be back to their homes and neighborhoods in an outpouring of love and gratitude to our police.

""I am extremely disappointed that they continue to have that level of violence and they continue to attack our police.""

On Sunday, police began blocking access to the event and told hundreds of college students and students near the airport in St. George, Illinois, not to attend the demonstration, the Chicago Tribune reports.

The school system said it did not send any messages regarding the planned protest. ""As this is an ongoing situation, we have not responded directly to any of the concerns raised,"" a spokesman for the school system said.

The protesters were also told to stay back at a school that is open since Friday, even after the university started offering a scholarship for students from other cities. Another group that helped build the fire was also allowed into the campus, which was temporarily closed due to protests on Saturday.

St. George is a community college located in the city's suburbs and houses more than 3,200 students and faculty. The school runs a private, nonprofit high school.","More than 1 million protesters packed downtown Chicago's Wachovia shopping center on Saturday to protest the government's refusal to provide an estimated 200,000 meals for tens of thousands of students.

their reservation as long as he is alive; ‘Congress, if it has its way, will arrest
people for even uttering the word Ram’
Addressing separate rallies in Haryana and Punjab ahead of polling in the sixth phase on
May 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday accused the Congress and its INDIAbloc partners of dividing the country into three nations, including two Muslim ones, in
order to appease their “vote bank”, and saying that Muslims have the first right on India.
He also said the alliance wants to snatch the reservation guaranteed by the Constitution
to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes and give it to those
who do “vote jihad”.
Campaigning for Dharambir Singh, the BJP’s candidate from the Bhiwani-Mahendragarh
Lok Sabha seat in Haryana, which goes to polls along with the nine other constituencies in
the State on May 25, Mr. Modi, referring to a recent West Bengal High Court verdict
cancelling five lakh OBC certificates, said the reservation meant for the OBCs was being
distributed to the “intruders”, exposing the anti-quota mentality of the INDIA bloc. “The
West Bengal CM has said she won’t adhere to the court order. She will give OBC quota to
Muslims. When the Congress, the TMC, and the INDI Alliance partners are standing
firmly with their vote bank, who will stand for you?”
The PM said he is the watchman of the rights of the deprived and has come to assure them
that no one can take away their reservation as long as he is alive. “It’s not a poll speech. It
is Modi’s guarantee,” he said.
Mr. Modi said the INDIA bloc partners can go to any length to keep their vote bank intact
and the Congress, if it has its way, will arrest people for even uttering the word “Ram”. He
said it wants to obliterate “Ram” from the country. “As long as the Congress was in power,
it did not allow the construction of the Ram Mandir. It even boycotted the consecration
ceremony. Now, an adviser to the Congress’s prince [Rahul Gandhi] has revealed that the
party wants to put a lock on the Ram Mandir if voted to power,” he said.
The PM said the INDIA bloc, anticipating its defeat after the third phase, has started
accusing the Election Commission of delaying the release of voter data to find a scapegoat
for its imminent loss. “Every vote cast for the Congress will be a waste, since it can never
form a government,” he said, adding that INDIA bloc parties are saying they will have five
PMs in five years if voted to power. “INDI Alliance only spreads the politics of
communalism, casteism, and dynasty,” he said.
‘Ineffective CM’
During a public meeting in support of BJP’s Patiala candidate Preneet Kaur, Mr. Modi
targeted the Bhagwant Mann-led AAP government in Punjab and said the sand mining
and drugs mafia, and shooter gangs are having a free run in the State and the government
seems powerless. He said Ministers and MLAs are having fun, and the “kagazi (ineffective)
CM” is busy attending the party’s “Delhi Darbar”. Referring to AAP and the Congress as
“Delhi’s staunchly corrupt” party, and party “accused of Sikh riots”, respectively, he said
they attack each other in Punjab but have an understanding in Delhi.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress and its allies of divisive politics and attempting to snatch away reservation rights from marginalized communities. He pledged to protect reservation guarantees and accused the opposition of prioritizing vote bank politics over the welfare of the deprived. Modi also criticized the Congress for allegedly neglecting the construction of the Ram Mandir and hinted at their intentions to obstruct its progress if in power. Additionally, he targeted the AAP government in Punjab, highlighting issues of corruption and inefficiency.

Chiles, with the support of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and USA Gymnastics, filed the appeal on Monday, a little over a month after CAS voided an on-floor appeal by Chiles’ coach Cecile Landi during the event finals on August 5 that vaulted Chiles from fifth to third.CAS, following a hearing requested by Romanian officials, ruled Landi's appeal came 4 seconds beyond the 1-minute time limit for scoring inquiries and recommended the initial finishing order be restored. The International Gymnastics Federation complied and the International Olympic Committee ended up awarding bronze to Romanian Ana Barbosu on August 16.

Chiles' appeal maintains that the CAS hearing violated her “right to be heard” by refusing to allow video evidence that Chiles and USA Gymnastics believe showed Landi appealed within the 1-minute time allotment. Chiles' appeal also argues that Hamid G. Gharavi, president of the CAS panel, has a conflict of interest due to past legal ties to Romania.

USA Gymnastics wrote in a statement Monday night that it made a “collective, strategic decision to have Jordan lead the initial filing. USAG is closely coordinating with Jordan and her legal team and will make supportive filings with the court in the continued pursuit of justice for Jordan.”

The appeal is the next step in what could be a months- or years-long legal battle over the gymnastics scores.

Chiles was last among the eight women to compete during the floor exercise finals initially given a score of 13.666 that placed her fifth, right behind Barbosu and fellow Romanian Sabrina Maneca-Voinea. Landi called for an inquiry on Chiles’ score.

“At this point, we had nothing to lose, so I was like ‘We’re just going to try,’” Landi said after the awards ceremony. “I honestly didn’t think it was going to happen, but when I heard her scream, I turned around and was like ‘What?’”

Judges awarded the appeal, leapfrogging Chiles past Barbosu and Maneca-Voinea for the last spot on the podium.

Romanian officials appealed to CAS on several fronts while also asking a bronze medal be awarded to Chiles, Barbosu and Maneca-Voinea. The FIG and the IOC ultimately gave the bronze to Barbosu, who beat her teammate on a tiebreaker because she produced a higher execution score during her routine.","American gymnast Jordan Chiles is appealing to Switzerland's Supreme Court to overturn a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which stripped her of a bronze medal in the floor exercise at the 2024 Olympics.

According to Goregaon police, the complainant, a 25-year-old woman, had met the accused in 2013 as he was a friend of her brother. The two later entered a relationship. In 2015, the accused asked the complainant to send him a nude photo of hers. He allegedly threatened to commit suicide and burn himself with cigarettes if she did comply.

Federation’s medical committee decides otherwise.
The court passed its order on Tuesday while hearing a petition filed by the India defender challenging the AIFF's
directive barring him from playing. Anwar, 20, has a congenital heart condition which some experts have said
poses a risk to his life, if he continues with competitive football.
“The court said the AIFF letter (issued on September 7) which asked him not to play will no longer prevent him
from playing till the medical committee decides. If the committee decision goes against Anwar, then we are at a
liberty to challenge that verdict,” Anwar’s lawyer, Amitabh Tewari, told TOI on Tuesday.
The AIFF panel will take a decision in three or four weeks. While previously the committee had decided against
allowing Anwar to play competitive football – with advice from the AFC medical council– the footballer’s case has
been helped by Professor Sanjay Sharma, chairman of the Cardiology Consensus Panel for England’s Football
Association.
Sharma told the AIFF’s medical council that the former Indian Arrows defender should be allowed to play, if he is
keen, and accepts the small risk of potentially serious arrhythmias.
A reputed member of the European Society of Cardiology, Sharma said recent recommendations published by
the ESC on August 29, 2020, are more liberal and suggest that it may be reasonable for some affected individuals
with morphologically mild disease to participate in high intensity exercise provided they were asymptomatic, had
a low ESC risk profile and did not have left ventricular outflow obstruction 30 mm Hg.

This has been done on the basis of the result of findings of a scientific survey adopted to fathom public
perception about the Congress in eight constituencies. Accordingly, the party has now staked its claim on 22
seats. Prior to this, the party had been sounded that it would be given eight parliamentary seats to contest. In the

Howeever, this procedure can be modified laparoscopically.After Tubal Ligation, a permanent form of contraception, due to unforeseen circumstances, some women may seek reversal of sterilization. Laparscopic tubal recanaliztion, being a minimally invasive surgery, has introduced a new dimension for tubal reconstruction. Short-term Laparoscopic tubal recanalization has emerged as an alternative to microsurgical reversal of a ligated fallopian tube. The procedure aims to reconnect the previously cut sections of the fallopian tube. After family planning, some women want to reverse the procedure that created the break in the fallopian tube. In the reverse procedure, the fallopian tubes are reconnected to re-fertilize.
What is Laproscopic Tubal Recanalization?
Tubal ligation is the tying of the fallopian tube, resulting in permanent contracepetion. Howeever, this procedure can be modified laparoscopically. It should be noted that women’s chances of becoming pregnant after re-canalization depend on age and the function of their ovaries. It is a sophisticated procedure perforned by only a few highly skilled surgeons.
Before the procedure:
The patient is thoroughly examined and investigated before the procedure will be explained in detail to the husband and wife. This procedure is performed only if the fallopian tubes are suitable for renastomosis and there is sufficient tube length.
What are Fallopian Tubes?
Important factors that determine the success of recanalization are the technique of sterilization and the remaining length of the tube after recanliztion. After the procedure is completed, the laparoscope is withdrawn and the sutures are closed with incisons.Advantages of Laproscopic Tubal Recanalization:Laproscopic Tubal Recanalization has many advantages over open operation. 
The main advantage of Laproscopic Tubal Recanalization is that there is no large skin incision, resulting in less scaring. The procedure requires minimal tissue handling, so postoperative adhesions are minimal. Smaller incisions also help with faster recovery after surgery. The range of complexity is kept low. In most cases, patients are able to leave the hospital post procedure within hours of the procedure.
","
Laparoscopic tubal recanalization is a minimally invasive surgery aimed at reversing tubal ligation, a permanent form of contraception where the fallopian tubes are tied or blocked. Through small incisions in the abdomen, a tiny camera and specialized tools are used to reconnect the previously cut or blocked sections of the fallopian tubes. This procedure allows for the possibility of restoring fertility by reopening the tubal pathway for eggs and sperm to meet. Patients benefit from smaller incisions, minimal scarring, and quicker recovery compared to traditional open surgery. However, the success of this procedure depends on factors like the condition of the fallopian tubes and the individual's fertility factors. Before undergoing laparoscopic tubal recanalization, thorough evaluations are conducted, and the procedure is explained in detail to the patient and their partner. It's performed by skilled surgeons and offers advantages such as minimal tissue handling and reduced postoperative complications. Overall, while laparoscopic tubal recanalization provides a potential option for those seeking to reverse tubal ligation, decisions should be made after careful consideration and consultation with a healthcare professional."

Pranav Gupta offers an overview of the results and analyses the likely contributing factors as well as the longer-term implications of the victory.

Bihar continued the ongoing trend of giving decisive verdicts as the Grand Alliance of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Janata Dal (United) (JDU) and the Congress won 178 out of the 243 seats in the state. The BJP faced a second successive defeat after Delhi and was reduced to just 53 seats. Its allies – the Lok Janshakti Party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party won just 5 out of the 86 seats that they had contested. In this article, I would provide a brief overview of the result and then re-look at how the probable factors I identified as polling began played out in the election. At the end, I will briefly comment upon some broader long term implications.

In terms of seats, the three parties which formed Grand Alliance to contest the election this year surpassed their 2014 Lok Sabha election performance. The NDA had led the Grand Alliance parties on 92 seats in 2014. The prime reason for this is the rise in the vote share gap between both alliances from 5.5 percentage points to 7.3 percentage points. This has occurred despite a decline in the absolute vote share of both alliances. The Grand Alliance’s vote share this time was 44.1 percent as compared to 44.3 percent in 2014. Similarly, the NDA’s vote share came down by close to 5 percentage points from 38.8 percent to 34.1 percent. The NDA suffered a vote share decline despite the addition of a new partner.","The Bihar election saw the Grand Alliance, comprising RJD, JD(U), and Congress, clinch 178 out of 243 seats, while the BJP and allies faltered with just 53 seats.

Factors contributing to this outcome and its long-term implications are analyzed, highlighting the evolving political landscape in Bihar."

These announcements were made by Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Durgadas Uikey on Thursday (June 19, 2025) at an event to mark the World Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Day at the AIIMS campus here. Mr. Uikey said the competition would be for the Bhagwan Birsa Munda Prize and the winning drug development project would get up to ₹10 crore in funding for taking the drug forward.

At the event meant to mark awareness of SCD, government officials said the Ministry had sanctioned Centre of Competence (CoC) in 15 tertiary care hospitals, including AIIMS, which were meant to provide “state-of-the-art diagnostics for and management of SCD, including ante-natal diagnosis.”

Course in ‘tribal medicine’

Mr. Uikey said there was also a proposal to offer a postgraduate course in “tribal medicine”, which “aims to address the long-standing health inequities faced by tribal communities“.

The government, in its statement, said the “specialised course” would be designed to develop a cadre of medical professionals with contextual knowledge, clinical skills and public health competencies “tailored to tribal settings”.

Ministry officials told The Hindu that the government’s efforts to develop a gene therapy for treating SCD were “progressing on the right path” and was in the trials stage for the time being.

In a statement issued on Thursday (June 18, 2025), the Union government said there was only a single drug available for the management of SCD. “There is currently no option to select a drug from a spectrum of drugs options for management of a patient, depending on his/her body conditions and severity of the disease.”

“This problem gets augmented in special situations such as pregnancy, other serious medical conditions etc. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of a new drug/s for the management of the disease,” it said on the announcement for the Bhagwan Birsa Munda Prize, adding that the competition for this drug development would be held by the Ministry in collaboration with AIIMS Delhi.

Guide in policymaking

On the setting up of the NTHRI, the government said this institute was meant to be an “advanced research centre for diseases particularly predominant among tribal people“. It would be expected to guide the government in policymaking in addition to its functions as an outpatient/inpatient facility for providing “highest quality medical care to tribal people”.

Currently, the Tribal Affairs Ministry’s guidelines for managing SCD cases amongst tribal populations entailed a process involving screening, management and counselling. Under the government’s programme run in collaboration with the Health Ministry, over 5.8 crore people had been screened for SCD across the 17 target States for SCD mission.

Of these, about 16.38 lakh people or close to 2.82% were found positive for SCD traits and a total of about 2.1 lakh people were found to be having Sickle Cell Disease. The proportion of people identified with SCD comprise about 0.36% of total screenings.","The Union government is planning to set up a National Tribal Health and Research Institute (NTHRI) under the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi and there are also plans to hold a competition for the development of drugs to manage Sickle Cell Disease, especially prevalent among certain tribal populations in the country. These announcements were made by Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Durgadas Uikey on Thursday (June 19, 2025) at an event to mark the World Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Day at the AIIMS campus here. At the event meant to mark awareness of SCD, government officials said the Ministry had sanctioned Centre of Competence (CoC) in 15 tertiary care hospitals, including AIIMS, which were meant to provide “state-of-the-art diagnostics for and management of SCD, including ante-natal diagnosis.” The government, in its statement, said the “specialised course” would be designed to develop a cadre of medical professionals with contextual knowledge, clinical skills and public health competencies “tailored to tribal settings”. Ministry officials told The Hindu that the government’s efforts to develop a gene therapy for treating SCD were “progressing on the right path” and was in the trials stage for the time being. In a statement issued on Thursday (June 18, 2025), the Union government said there was only a single drug available for the management of SCD. On the setting up of the NTHRI, the government said this institute was meant to be an “advanced research centre for diseases particularly predominant among tribal people“. It would be expected to guide the government in policymaking in addition to its functions as an outpatient/inpatient facility for providing “highest quality medical care to tribal people”."

Why does the civic body still issue handwritten pathology reports despite there being computers and printers and latest blood testing equipment at many of its health centres? These and many other issues were raised during the zero hour of the health and solid waste management committee meeting of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Tuesday.

6954f31bdf045e60a659cb068b4d2568,"[DOC 1] An aqua-blue light appeared on my outstretched palm, showing a menu. Slowly, I circled my wrist to scroll, pressing an index finger and thumb together
in a pinching motion to select an item. I wanted to send a text message. The device on my sweater, a 2-inch-square magnetic pin from a startup called Humane, let out a soft “clink”.

I spoke, and the words leaving my mouth projected instantly into my hand. Squeezing a fist, the message sent with a “whoosh” sound.The gadget, called the Ai Pin, is a new take on wearable devices that aims to supplant, or at least help wean us off, our addiction to screens. Its features include answering questions, making calls, sending texts, playing music and taking photos. It costs $699 and a $24 monthly subscription. The company hopes to ship the devices by early 2024.

It was, like any new technology, equal parts magical and awkward. It took a few seconds of waving my hand in front of my chest to find the laser menu. The circling wrist motion takes a second to nail as well. In 10 minutes of wearing the device at the company’s offices, I gradually learned how to hold the light and manipulate it.Most fun, in my view, was the pinching motion. Pinch: Play a new song. Pinch: Start a new message. Pinch: Back to the menu. The company refers to this motion as “picking”, said Imran Chaudhri, Humane’s co-founder. “Pinching hurts,” he said.

I quickly ran out of things to pinch, because unlike my smartphone, which offers a steady barrage of dopamine in the form of emails, texts, hearts, news alerts, cute dog pictures and other notifications, Humane’s Ai Pin is meant to fade into the background of everyday life. I told Ken Kocienda, Humane’s head of product engineering, that the device seemed to get you in and out quickly. It is not begging me to lose another 45 minutes inside TikTok.

“It’s more of a pull than pushing content at you in the way iPhones do,” he said. I dropped my hand, and the light disappeared.To ask a question, I tapped the pin’s touch screen. To take a photo, I double-tapped. But to actually see the photo, I would need a screen. Humane customers will have access to an online hub with 32 gigabytes of storage.

The device’s “personic speakers” (a portmanteau of personal and sonic) played music via the streaming service Tidal. Early customers will get a trial subscription. I quickly learned that it was much faster to use voice commands to change songs, the way I would on a home speaker with Alexa, Siri or Google. It felt a bit as if I’d smuggled Alexa out of the house and was wearing her on my sweater.

The Ai Pin’s underlying technology differs from other smart assistants in that it is not always on — users must touch the device to wake it. And its assistant uses artificial intelligence technology to deliver information in a conversational way. It can remember past queries and notes to self. (The note-to-self feature froze up in one demo.)

Kocienda demonstrated this by asking a series of history questions about
The New York Times that built on one another, which the pin answered in roughly the same amount of time it might take to search Wikipedia on my phone.
The point, he said, was that we didn’t have to disappear into our screens.

“We’re looking at each other while all this is going on,” Kocienda said. “We’re not being distracted.”","Humane, a startup, has introduced a new wearable device called the Ai Pin, designed to reduce dependence on screens. Priced at $699 with a $24 monthly subscription, the 2-inch-square magnetic pin projects an aqua-blue light onto the user's palm, allowing for gesture-based interactions. Users can answer questions, make calls, send texts, play music, and take photos using hand gestures. The device aims to provide a less distracting and more conversational alternative to smartphones, emphasizing a quick in-and-out interaction model. The Ai Pin uses touch to wake and employs artificial intelligence for a conversational assistant experience. The company plans to ship the devices by early 2024.

While talking to the TNS, Prof Rizvi said,‘‘ The dairy industry in Punjab might be doing better in comparison to the milk processing units of other states such as UP and Bihar. But it would be very difficult to compete with cheap imported milk items once the imports are opened. ’’

Prof Rizvi was visiting the Verka Milk Plant today. Mr Rizvi is a product of National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), now a deemed university in Karnal.

Appreciating the milk processing industry’s role in the development of the state economy, he emphasised on the development of new product chains, such as butter with a traditional ghee taste, mozerella cheese, and pizzas.

Regarding the present status, he pointed out that the milk plants should concentrate on the hygiene and nutritious value of products. The improvement in the quality of products was the need of the hour.

When asked what was wrong with the dairy industry in Punjab, Mr Rizvi said, ‘‘Our cooperative units have a lot of potential provided they are liberated from the bureaucratic and administrative hassles. AMUL has done good work, but unfortunately it cannot be replicated everywhere.’’

About the potential of the dairy industry in the country, Prof Rizvi said our share in the processed milk trade in the world was not even one per cent. At the same time, there was a potential of 20-25 per cent growth of processed milk products in the domestic market.

156ff9387a99a472aa48a934825bcd78,"[DOC 1] Kashmir’s highly shy and sensitive animal, hangul, which is enlisted as a critically endangered indigenous species of deer, has reported one of the healthiest rutting or mating seasons in the previous autumn. Experts suggested the roars or calls made by hangul during rutting indicate that their number will cross 300 this spring, the first time in more than three decades.

“The calls recorded by the wildlife staff during the rutting season in October last year were healthy compared to previous years. In fact, the Dachigam National Park, home to hangul, was closed between September 25 to October 18 for visitors to allow unhindered rutting,” Rashid Naqash, Regional Wildlife Warden, Kashmir, told The Hindu.

 Forays of the Kashmir stag

These calls were recorded from around 25 nallah or drainages in middle and lower reaches of Dachigam National Park, spread over 141 square kilometres, in Srinagar.

A male deer roars and groans during courtship to attract a female deer or hind. The animals keep calling back and forth for half an hour or more, especially during dawn and dusk. Officials sighted a male deer with a larger group of hind and fawns (young deer), “as big as 15” in the autumn.

Since 1947, the population of hangul, which is the State animal of Jammu and Kashmir, witnessed a sharp decline. In 1947, around 2000 were spotted and the number fell to 384 by 1968.

In 1988, the hangul population was estimated to be around 1,000 and fell drastically to 140 to 160 in 1992, as militancy raged in Kashmir and the movement of large columns of security forces and also of militants increased in the area.

The hangul population was estimated at a mere 197 in 2004, touched the lowest of 183 in 2015 and showed a steady increase to 261 in 2021, according to Wildlife department figures.

“Multiple disturbances, including stress on forest areas and human intervention, did disturb the habitat of hangul. However, we are able to provide better environments now. We plan to secure all corridors, especially the Wangath-Naranag corridor in the north. We are coming up with a mechanism to ensure that the groups of hangul move safely on the highways in Ganderbal by regulating traffic,” Mr. Naqash said.

With 11-to-16-point antlers, the hangul is also facing a skewed male-female ratio. The official figure suggested there are 19.2 males per 100 females “which is much lower than the ideal ratios of 40-50 male per 100 females”.

Dr. Khursheed Ahmad, head of the Wildlife Sciences Faculty of Forestry at the Sher-i-Kashmir Agricultural and Science Technology-Kashmir, has identified a few threats that the hangul faces in the national park.

“Leopards and Asiatic Black Bears are the major predators in the area. Hangul formed a major proportion, about 25%, of the leopard diet at Dachigam. It needs more research,” Mr. Ahmad said.

He warned that most of the drainages in Dachigam were seen to be dried up throughout the year, probably due to the impact of global warming and the glacial areas of Upper Dachigam have been observed to be snowless even during the beginning of summer.

“Non-availability of water in the near vicinity might have forced the hangul, especially lactating females in summer, to move towards the disturbed habitats in and outside Dachigam. This might as well be acting as one of the factors for fawn mortality to predators or even sheep dogs,” Mr. Ahmad said.

The J&K Wildlife department has identified 10 hangul sites “to provide a protection mechanism to ensure sustenance”. A captive breeding of hangul has been set up at Shikargah Tral.

“Founder population for the breeding would be taken from Dachigam and modern reproductive biotechnologies or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) would be employed to augment the population,” Mr. Naqash said.

Radio-collaring of hanguls in 2013 and 2020 is proving pathbreaking for the conservation plans. Officials said it is because of radio-collaring they realised that adult males with full grown antlers and dominant males during the rutting season were not safe to capture. “The captive breeding will help in establishment of genome resource banking and embryo bank,” Mr. Naqash said.","Kashmir’s highly shy and sensitive animal, hangul, which is enlisted as a critically endangered indigenous species of deer, has reported one of the healthiest rutting or mating seasons in the previous autumn. Experts suggested the roars or calls made by hangul during rutting indicate that their number will cross 300 this spring, the first time in more than three decades."

India’s most indebted firm Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL), with outstanding loans of ₹2.13 lakh crore, plans to deleverage as it nears the completion of its ₹3 lakh-crore capital expenditure cycle.“If you look at the way our earnings are shaping up, across hydrocarbons, across Jio, across retail, we will have enough free cash flow,” V. Srikanth, joint CFO, RIL, told The Hindu .

“We are earning a lot and our earnings are going to be way bigger in coming quarters. This quarter is just the beginning, which does not even factor in refinery off-gas cracker’s (ROGC) full capability,” he said.

“We are talking about ROGC full capability in the next quarter and then gasification economics coming in a big way in the next quarter and there will be sequential growth. So, cash flows are going to be much stronger in the next financial year and a positive free cash flow by definition means that your level of debt will only be coming down.”

However, with Moody’s Investors Service estimating that Reliance Jio likely to invest as much as $23 billion over three to four years as it expands beyond wireless services, a significant reduction in RIL’s debt may take longer to achieve.

The company is also set to invest about $4 billion in acquiring telecom assets of Reliance Communications.

Queried about the Moody’s report projecting the $23 billion investment, Mr. Srikanth said, “Moody’s report is a bit of a surprise. My understanding is that they have ticketed $15 billion to $23 billion. The way Moody’s looks at cash flow, if you have to pay suppliers 12 months from now, it’s included. When you look to pay suppliers, that number itself is going to be $12-13 billion. Even if you look at whatever set of numbers we need to continue to grow, we will have enough positive cash flows.”

RIL’s outstanding debt as on December 31, 2017, stood at ₹2,13,206 crore ($33.4 billion) compared with ₹1,96,601 crore as on March 31, 2017. The company had cash and cash equivalents of ₹78,617 crore ($ 12.3 billion) as on December 31 .

‘Rising financing cost’

An increase in debt had led RIL’s finance cost to rise significantly to ₹2,095 crore ($328 million) compared with ₹1,204 crore in the year-earlier period.

RIL attributed the increase in finance cost to lower capitalisation of financial costs related to commencement of digital services business and higher loan balance partially offset by exchange rate variation during the quarter.

The company last week reported a 25% jump in net profit to ₹9,423 crore on revenue of ₹1,09,905 crore.

RIL shares closed flat at ₹964.55 on the BSE on Thursday, valuing the company at ₹6,10,938 crore.","Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), India's most indebted firm with outstanding loans of ₹2.13 lakh crore, plans to reduce its debt as it nears the completion of its ₹3 lakh-crore capital expenditure cycle.

However, Moody's projects significant investments by Reliance Jio, and reducing debt may take longer. As of December 31, 2017, RIL's outstanding debt was ₹2,13,206 crore, with plans to deleverage amid robust earnings across its business segments."

The victim,whose identity is yet to be established,jumped from the Metro station at around 7 pm,official sources said.","On Monday evening, a tragic incident occurred at the Punjabi Bagh elevated station of the Delhi Metro when a woman jumped to her death. The incident took place around 7 p.m., according to official sources. As of now, the identity of the woman remains unknown, and authorities are working to determine who she was and what may have led to this drastic step.

Eyewitnesses at the scene reported a sudden commotion as the woman jumped from the elevated platform. Emergency services were immediately alerted, and the police arrived at the site shortly after. The woman was found critically injured and was rushed to a nearby hospital, but unfortunately, she was declared dead on arrival.

The incident has raised serious concerns about safety measures at Metro stations, especially those located on elevated structures. While the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has implemented several safety protocols, including CCTV surveillance and staff presence, such incidents point to potential gaps in preventive strategies.

Police have launched an investigation and are reviewing CCTV footage to trace the woman’s last movements. Efforts are also underway to identify her through missing persons reports and public appeals. Authorities are treating the case as a suicide but are keeping all possibilities open pending further investigation.

e1cda46105af060fec1ee576ee157709,"[DOC 1] The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Wednesday cleared a ₹89,047 crore revival package for Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), the third such government handout for the state-run telco since 2019. The carrier will use the amount for acquiring spectrum, so that it can begin to offer 4G services within months and 5G services by 2024 across the country.

With this, the total government assistance to India’s No. 4 carrier has swelled to ₹3.22 trillion. The government had earlier approved a ₹69,000 crore package in 2019 to revive and stabilize the telecom business, followed by ₹1.64 trillion in July 2022 to improve its balance sheet and expand capex.

The latest package is meant for securing 5G spectrum in the 700 Mhz, 3300 Mhz, 26 Ghz, and 2,500 Mhz bands, which can be used for 4G as well. The airwaves will be given at auction-determined prices plus goods and services tax, which amounts to ₹46,338 crore, ₹26,184 crore, ₹6,564 crore, and ₹9,428 crore for the four bands. BSNL’s authorized capital will rise from ₹1.5 trillion to ₹2.1 trillion.

“Time has come that BSNL should be in the leagues of major players in the country, and provide services where others do not provide,” said communications and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. He said the carrier will have to provide good quality services in order to compete with the market on its own. Private telcos Airtel and Reliance Jio have already begun offering 5G services across 200,000 sites in the country.

“With this spectrum allotment, BSNL will be able to provide pan-India 4G, 5G services, fixed wireless access services, captive non-public networks and coverage in rural and uncovered villages,” Vaishnaw added. BSNL has already placed orders with TCS-CDoT and ITI to buy equipment for 100,000 4G sites for about ₹19,000 crore.

Vaishnaw said BSNL will become debt-free in three years, and that the government won’t infuse any further equity or provide additional state-backed debt.

BSNL chairman and managing director P.K. Purwar said the debt reduction will take place through internal accruals. Debt has been reduced by ₹10,000 crore by FY23-end to ₹22,289 crore, he said. He added that within six months, the carrier will revamp its IT, HR and technology platforms to make them consumer-friendly to compete in the market. “4G and 5G installations have been done in 200 sites, and those will be tested live for three months, after which there will be rapid rollout,” the minister added. He also noted that 3G will be shut down, as has been done by other private operators.

Among other decisions, the CCEA approved an increase in minimum support price (MSP) for 14 mandated kharif crops for 2023-24, including paddy, maize, cotton, tur, and bajra.

Mint had first reported in May that the government may increase MSP for key kharif crops in 2023-24 by 3-8%, with moong potentially witnessing the season’s highest among key cereals and pulses. MSP for moong was increased the highest among all 14 kharif crops to ₹8,558 per quintal from 2022’s ₹7,755 a quintal.

After moong, the second-biggest hike was for sesame to ₹8,635 a quintal from ₹7,830 earlier. The Centre has fixed cotton MSP at ₹6,620 a quintal for medium staple variety and ₹7,020 per quintal for long staple variety, ₹540 and ₹640 above the previous season’s prices. The MSP for paddy (common) has been fixed at ₹2,183 per quintal, against ₹2,040 per quintal in the last season, while the MSP for paddy (grade A) has been fixed at ₹2,203 per quintal, against 2022’s ₹2,060 per quintal.

The hike in MSP will “ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce and encourage crop diversification,” Union food minister Piyush Goyal told reporters.

“The increase of 8.9% in MSP of cotton is good news as farmers who had withheld cotton have realized lower prices, while paddy MSP is more than the same in maize,” said former Union agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain. “It seems there is a realization that maize cannot really be used for ethanol.”

MSP serves as a crucial safety net for farmers in India by guaranteeing a minimum price for their produce. It also helps ensure food security and stabilizes market prices of staples. The government also uses the MSP to encourage farmers to cultivate certain crops.

“While the MSP press release providing reference cost data suggests the reference cost is for the 2023-24 kharif season, it does not seem to be the case. Cost data seems to be from 2020-21 cost of cultivation estimates, which means that MSP misses to compensate for cost increase from 2021-22 to 2023-24,” said Anil Sood, a farm expert. “The imputed value of labour and land are extremely low, and don’t provide for a fair cost of living for a farming family. We must link imputed values to fair cost and reference C3 costs for MSP to prevent farmers from giving up agriculture and if we want rural economy to progress. Nine-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in MSP suggests that we just about cover the cost of general inflation for paddy and maize farmers,” Sood added.

The CCEA also approved the continuation of ‘Exploration of Coal and Lignite scheme’, a central sector scheme with an estimated additional expenditure of ₹2,980 crore for the period of FY22 to FY26.

The approval will provide an outlay of ₹1,650 crore for ‘Promotional (Regional) Exploration’ and ₹1,330 crore for ‘Detailed Drilling’ in non-Coal India Ltd areas. Approximately 1,300 sq. km area will be covered under regional exploration, and around 650 sq. km area will be covered under detailed exploration.

Regional exploration is the first stage of exploration wherein large areas are explored to find broad availability of coal seams and other resources. Detailed exploration is carried out in the second stage in potential areas identified under regional or promotional exploration.

The Cabinet also approved metro connectivity from Huda City Centre to Cyber City with Spur to Dwarka Expressway, Gurugram, covering the distance of 28.50 km having 27 stations on the route.","The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in India has approved a INR 89,047 crore ($11.8 billion) revival package for state-run telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).

The MEA also announced that the first '2+2' foreign and defence ministerial dialogue between India and Russia will be held in here on December 6 as well.

The Modi-Putin summit is expected to produce specific outcomes in further expanding ties in areas of defence, trade and energy, officials said.

It is learnt that the two sides are going to firm up a number of agreements in the areas of defence, trade and investment, and science and technology at the summit.

“President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin will pay an official visit to New Delhi on December 6 for the 21st India-Russia annual summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” MEA Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said at a media briefing.

It will be the first in-person meeting between the two leaders after their talks on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brasilia in November 2019. There have been six telephonic conversations between the two leaders since November 2019, to date apart from virtual meetings for multilateral summits.
The last India-Russia annual summit was held in September 2019 during the visit of Modi to Vladivostok. The annual summit could not take place last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The leaders will review the state and prospects of bilateral relations and discuss ways to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries,” Bagchi said.

“The summit will also afford an opportunity to exchange views on regional, multilateral and international issues of mutual interest,” he said. He said the visit will provide further impetus to the India-Russia special and privileged strategic partnership.

On the '2+2' dialogue, Bagchi said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu will be visiting India from December 5 to 6.

“The 2+2 Dialogue is being held pursuant to the agreement reached between Prime Minister Modi and Russian President Putin during their telephonic conversation on 28 April. The agenda for the dialogue will cover political and defence issues of mutual interest,” he said.
So far India has the '2+2' ministerial format of dialogue with the US, Japan and Australia. A framework for military-technical cooperation is set to be renewed for the next decade at the summit besides announcing a joint commission on technology and science.

India and Russia have also reached the final phase of negotiation for a logistics support agreement and it is likely to be signed either during the two-plus-two talks or at the summit.

The pact will allow militaries of the two countries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation.

Russia has been a time-tested partner for India and the country has been a key pillar of New Delhi's foreign policy.","Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to visit India on December 6 for the 21st India-Russia annual summit, where they will review bilateral ties and discuss regional, multilateral, and international issues of mutual interest.

A tiger skin was also recovered from his Jabalpur residence, prompting a separate wildlife offence case.

Sarvate did not respond to calls and messages seeking a comment.

A zero FIR was initially lodged in Jabalpur on July 21 and later forwarded toBhopalfor formal registration.

The FIR notes that Sarvate entered government service on September 7, 1989, and joined his present cadre on December 13, 2004. His salary records were collected from the Jabalpur treasury office and the State Bank of India, where he maintains his salary account.

The investigators alleged that “the total expenditure of Rs 3.95 crore far exceeds his legal income of Rs 1.57 crore, resulting in disproportionate assets of Rs 2.38 crore.”

The EOW states that since the “allegations of amassing disproportionate assets appear prima facie established, a case has been registered… against the accused.”

During the investigation, Sarvate was found to have allegedly purchased a commercial plot worth Rs 46.38 lakh and a residential house worth Rs 16.52 lakh in Mocha village, Mandla district, the FIR states. It also states that a “resort is under construction at the combined location, with an estimated cost of Rs 20 lakh.”

His Bhopal residence was allegedly found to have construction worth Rs 50 lakh.

Additionally, he allegedly purchased 4.046 hectares of agricultural land in Talla village in Umaria district for Rs 1.53 crore; multiple parcels of farmland in Pataur village, Umaria district, for Rs 22.6 lakh; and a plot in Kohka, Seoni district, for Rs 15.9 lakh.

During a search of Sarvate’s ancestral house in Adhartal, Jabalpur, EOW teams allegedly discovered a tiger skin being used as a seat cover. Officials said the skin appeared to be around 30 years old. The Forest Department was informed, and a separate offence is set to be registered under Sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

Integration costs, talent shortages, and concerns over data governance and model transparency are slowing the broader adoption of generative AI. A 2024 Reuters/Ipsos survey found that 44% of manufacturing leaders remain cautious about scaling generative AI due to concerns about hallucinations and explainability.  | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Step inside a modern factory, and you might find something quietly extraordinary. Machines no longer wait to fail; they signal in advance. Robots don’t just repeat tasks; they adapt and respond. And decisions once made on instinct are now driven by real-time data. This is the new face of manufacturing, where artificial intelligence (AI) is not just an upgrade but a fundamental shift in how things are made, moved and managed. Across India, from long-established facilities to newly-built plants, AI is being integrated into every layer of production. It is helping manufacturers increase output, reduce waste, adapt to shifting demands and even design more intelligently. Backed by national policy and rising enterprise ambition, India’s factories are becoming more agile, more precise and more globally competitive. The global AI-in-manufacturing market is projected to grow from $4.1 billion in 2024 to $5.8 billion in 2025, and is expected to surpass $25 billion by 2029, according to The Business Research Company. In India, adoption is accelerating. TeamLease data shows AI use across industries stood at 48% in FY2024, with manufacturing alone rising from 8% to 22% in just one year. This is supported by policy initiatives like the Government of India’s ₹10,372-crore AI Mission, which is investing in infrastructure, talent, and indigenous models. “From predictive maintenance to intelligent automation, AI and GenAI are turning manufacturing industries into self-optimising systems. Real-time data is being leveraged to drive smarter decisions, higher throughput, and more sustainable, customer-centric outcomes. When combined with responsible AI frameworks, this shift drives both operational excellence and enhanced customer value,” says Sanjay Mittal, senior partner and industrial sector leader, IBM Consulting India & South Asia. AI is powering improvements across every layer of the factory. On the shop floor, predictive maintenance uses sensor data to anticipate equipment failures, reducing downtime by up to 30%, according to McKinsey. AI vision systems identify micro-level defects in real time, improving quality assurance. Cobots—collaborative robots guided by AI—support workers in physically demanding or repetitive tasks. These machines respond to human cues, enabling safer, more efficient man-machine collaboration. “Today, CPCL generates about 1 TB of data daily. AI-powered CCTVs are helping ensure SOP compliance, while machine learning supports predictive maintenance and smart procurement. Digital twins and centralised safety monitoring are our focus to steadily transform our operations,” says H. Shankar, managing director, Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited. Further upstream, generative AI accelerates product development. Digital twins simulate layouts, energy use and asset health, helping engineers optimise operations virtually. In planning and logistics, AI enhances forecasting and enables more agile scheduling. IBM estimates that AI-led planning improves responsiveness by over 20%. “At ZF Group in India, we’re integrating smart manufacturing technologies like AI, robotics, and automation to transform our operations. AI is helping us redesign workflows by reducing task complexity and enhancing labour flexibility, empowering shop-floor teams to manage more intricate processes. AI-powered vision systems are also improving quality control by eliminating fatigue-related errors and increasing inspection efficiency,” says Akash Passey, president, ZF Group India AI draws strength from a wider digital ecosystem that enables speed, scale, and integration. At the edge, IoT sensors capture real-time data from machines, materials, and the environment. Edge computing allows instant responses for tasks like robotic actuation and safety control. Cloud platforms provide the scale to train models, run digital twins, and coordinate cross-site operations. These platforms allow AI to be deployed flexibly and integrated into existing enterprise systems. Emerging technologies such as autonomous control systems and agentic AI offer even more adaptability. These systems learn, plan and optimise processes with minimal human input. Crucially, these layers are connected through APIs and integration hubs that link AI with ERP, supply chain, and production systems. This ensures insights are shared across the organisation to enable better decision-making. AI creates value at two levels. First, through operational hygiene. Predictive maintenance, automated inspections, and real-time stock tracking are fast becoming industry norms. These improvements lower costs and improve compliance, but are no longer enough to differentiate. “We are now exploring AI-driven process optimisation to improve yields and reduce energy use, deploying drones for safer inspections, and planning AI-driven logistics. As AI and automation evolve, the opportunity to unlock smarter, safer, and more efficient operations continues to grow,” adds Mr. Shankar of CPCL. Second, AI is unlocking innovation. Generative tools speed up design. AI-driven customisation enables personalisation at scale. Companies that embed AI across their value chain—from R&D to delivery—are more agile, responsive, and future-ready. Challenges persist. Integration costs, talent shortages and concerns over data governance and model transparency are slowing broader adoption. A 2024 Reuters/Ipsos survey found that 44% of manufacturing leaders remain cautious about scaling generative AI due to concerns around hallucinations and explainability. Still, the direction is clear. AI will be central to India’s ambition of becoming a $5 trillion manufacturing economy. With the right mix of strategy, skills, and Indian manufacturers are well positioned to lead the next wave of global industrial transformation. Published - July 11, 2025 08:17 pm IST AI@Work
","Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally changing the way things are made, moved, and managed in modern manufacturing. Adopted across India, AI is helping manufacturers increase output, reduce waste, adapt to shifting demands, and design more intelligently. Growing investment and national policy initiatives are accelerating the adoption of AI in manufacturing, which is expected to surpass $25 billion globally by 2029.

a8c4346606638513166aae7a9ae8b4fb,"[DOC 1] Margao: The unusual presence of such a large posse of policemen took many by surprise.
The Indian Super League (ISL) final between Chennaiyin FC and ATK was supposed to be played behind closed
doors. But when accredited officials and registered media reached the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday,
the policemen caught their eye.
There were many of them outside the VIP gate. Some were relaxed, while most others were alert, wearing masks
that are meant to protect them against the deadly coronavirus. Why so many policemen were around for a game
that could officially have less than 200 people remained a surprise.
Just like the cops, masks were unmistakable at Fatorda.
The security officials who frisked you at the gate and checked your bags for anything untoward didn’t want to
take any chance. Almost all of them wore masks, and anyone who entered the stadium had to first use the hand
sanitiser before moving ahead.
At the media tribune, the most crowded area at the stadium with approximately 30 journalists, it wasn’t any
different. Team lineups were next to hand sanitisers. There was even a medical kiosk, just in case of emergency.
The stadium, though, was largely quiet. You got that empty feeling. Not surprising because fans were not
allowed. When the Chennaiyin team bus made their way inside the stadium, there were a handful of travelling
fans who made their presence felt. But when the match kicked off, the players were on their own.
There was no cheering. The 20-odd officials per team who were provided accreditation for the final and allowed
to watch the game from the VVIP enclosure tried their best. They cheered loudly. Even Bollywood actor and
Chennaiyin co-owner Abhishek Bachchan joined them.
The VVIP enclosure largely had wives and girlfriends of players. There was ATK striker Roy Krishna’s wife, and in
the same row there was Mrs Garcia. Had it not been for a cancellation of visa while she was on her way to India
from Australia, even David Williams’ wife would have been here.
It must have been strange for the players. They were playing the most important match of the season, and there
was nobody to cheer them. Players like Arindam Bhattacharya – voted Man of the Match for his spectacular
performance under the ATK horizontal – and Pritam Kotal never fail to call their mothers before a game. How they
must have loved to see them at the stadium after winning the ISL trophy.
“It’s a different feeling (without spectators at the stadium). I was talking to the players (before the game) and
trying to motivate them. Without an atmosphere (at the stadium), they had to be encouraged, motivated. We
have a big problem across the world with coronavirus. Tackling that is more important than football,” said ATK
coach Antonio Habas.
When Javier Hernandez scored the opening goal for ATK, he tried to look for appreciation from the stands and
got nothing in return. Instead, it were his teammates who mobbed him. When the referee blew the final whistle,
the players first celebrated among themselves and then walked up below the VVIP enclosure and danced away
to glory.
Surely, they missed the support from the stands. They missed the adulation. They missed the irreplaceable noise.
Like Habas said, this final had an unusual feel to it","The Indian Super League (ISL) final between Chennaiyin FC and ATK unfolded with an unusual atmosphere due to Covid-19 restrictions. Despite being played behind closed doors, the presence of a large contingent of policemen and strict security measures surprised many at Fatorda's Nehru Stadium in Margao. Masks were ubiquitous, and stringent hygiene protocols were enforced, reflecting the ongoing pandemic concerns. Although the stadium remained quiet without fans, the few accredited officials and media personnel witnessed the match from a sanitized environment, with notable figures like Bollywood actor Abhishek Bachchan offering support. Players grappled with the absence of cheering crowds, finding solace in celebrating amongst themselves after pivotal moments. ATK coach Antonio Habas acknowledged the unprecedented circumstances, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing public health over football. While the players missed the fervent support of spectators, they triumphed in an atmosphere marked by its unusual silence."

215746e1bceea8e9fed05481677f96db,"[DOC 1] NEW DELHI, 8 May:  Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s chair is “shaking” after three phases of the Lok Sabha polls as he has started attacking his own “friends” and this shows the “real trend” of the result.

His remarks came after the prime minister during an election rally in Telangana said the Congress should explain to people why it has stopped raising the “Ambani-Adani” issue as its “Shehzada” used to do for the past five years and asked if it has struck a “deal.”

“The times are changing. Friends are no longer friends…! After the completion of three phases of elections, today the prime minister has started attacking his own friends. It is becoming clear that Modiji’s chair is shaking. This is the real trend of the results,” Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X.

At a poll rally in Telangana’s Vemulavada, Modi said, “Ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani. Has tempo loads of notes (currency) reached the Congress? What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight.”

“Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of ‘chori ka maal’ (loot). You have to answer the nation,” the prime minister further said.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s position is unstable after the first three phases of the Lok Sabha elections. Kharge suggested Modi's attacks on his own allies reveal this instability. His comments follow Modi’s remarks at a rally in Telangana, where Modi questioned why Congress stopped criticizing business tycoons Ambani and Adani, implying a possible political deal. Modi accused Congress of silence on these issues after the elections began, hinting at corruption.

The FMR allows people on both sides of the international border to move within a 16 km radius across the border without a visa. The bilateral arrangement, initiated in the 1970s, allows people who share kinship with those on the other side of the border to maintain their mutual age-old relations. Protesters were demanding continuation of the FMR between the two neighbouring countries.


At least two MLAs of the ruling Zoram People’s Party (ZPM) took part in the protest. Interestingly, Zomi Reunification Organization (ZORO) general secretary L Ramdinliana Renthlei threatened to take up arms, if the Centre goes ahead with its plan to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and withdraw the FMR, they will take this as a Declaration of Independence for the ethnic Zo or Mizo communities. He also warned,


""If the Centre continues its plan to fence the border and ditch the FMR, the youths will have no other alternative but to take up arms again.” Well, Mizo insurgency under the leadership of Laldenga in the 60s sought separation of Mizo territories from India, but the genesis of the movement was birthed by Centre’s indifference to a severe famine in the state in the late 50s.

On Thursday Lydian was declared the winner, taking home $1 million in prize money.

The Chennai youngster, who spent four years at maestro A.R. Rahman’s KM Music Conservatory and is now tutored by his father Varshan Satish, stunned the judges at the contest by playing 280 beats per minute. He then increased his speed to 325 beats per minute.

“This is genuinely one of the best things I’ve ever seen live,” tweeted James Corden, host of the show.

Lydian also featured on the Ellen DeGeneres show last week after his appearance on the ‘The World’s Best’ contest.

The teenager, who is home schooled, told The Hindu that he spends on an average of six hours a day practising music under the guidance of his father Varshan Satish, a music director.

“I listen to music on YouTube and spend time going through music software. Along with my sister, I experiment a lot and we compose our own music,” said Lydian. The prodigy can play blindfolded, handle two pianos simultaneously, apart from being adept at playing the guitar and mridangam, his mother Jhansi said with legitimate pride.

Currently, he is investing time on the technical side learning skills such as mixing, sound systems.

The lad does not watch much television, but he is a regular on YouTube. “I recently picked up a movie from YouTube, then muted the sound and created my own audio. It was fun,” he said. Citing an example, he said he had tried this experiment with the animation Storks.

His performance has earned him an invite to the Jazz Foundation of America’s annual gala “A Great Night in Harlem” at the Apollo Theatre in New York on April 4.

Lydian says he wants to compose music for Hollywood. “I want to work for an animation film,” he said, adding that he also wants to play the piano on the moon at some point.

 

Lydian’s father, Varshan, said: “Last year, Micheal Novogratz sent Lydian a Steinway grand piano. Now he has invited him to perform at the concert with some musicians.”

His mother Jhansi proudly said that he also plays the guitar, mridangam among other instruments.

903d58a4a38f5ce1917463c9bed71e3f,"[DOC 1] Deflation is stalking the markets, stoked by the news that the US consumer prices and producer prices index dropped. Is this the dreaded arrival of Japanese style deflation, asks Dr Dasgupta.The India Babble
The markets showed a steady rise all through the week and ended up almost 100 points upwards. This was backed by a set of reasonably good figures.

There was a reported small drop in inflation to 6.14%, giving rise to a positive basis for optimistic sentiment across the board. Industrial output for the year ending March 2003 showed that it had grown by a robust 5.8% and 6% in March 2003.

We frequently ignore this good performance by India, but comparatively speaking, the latest monthly figures from Japan showed an industrial production increase of 3.8%, UK showed a negative -0.8%, USA showed a anaemic +0.4% while the Euro area had a +1.8% growth rate. Pretty good going, I would say.

The Indian industrial recovery is not patchy but across all sectors. Business confidence took a dip on the ET-NCAER business confidence index dropping about 3 points in April, but I expect this to be the Iraq War fallout and should not materially impact the growing recovery. The rupee is steadily appreciating  due to the US dollar weakness, as well as significant inflows from the NRI’s and foreign portfolio investments.

An interesting report crossed my desk about the situation with respect to ports in the Arabian Sea. The premier port seems to be Dubai, with Mumbai and Colombo following. The Indian efforts to develop the Chah Bahar port in Iran is a good step, which should increase our trade efforts into the central Asian republics through Iran and Afghanistan.

Given some of the state government’s lethargy and looming local elections, they are distracted and rather unable or unwilling to understand the sheer impact of this proposal on their state’s finances. Nobody ever accused our states of being financially smart!

Outsourcing is still in the news, with Convergys, Intuit, JP Morgan and America Online announcing take up of outsourcing contracts in India. Some good news from the trade front with the ASEAN countries and India deciding to speed up the import tariff reduction process, even before the full free trade area agreement comes into the picture. This will be a good step. Given
the European intransigence over the Doha round, I have to say that regional free trade agreements are the way forward. What I do not understand is why the grand poo bah’s at the Ministry of Industry and Trade are not working on linking other areas such as Latin America, Japan and even the USA/EU?

Petrol prices dropping in India? Not once but the third time in as many weeks? Goodness me, what is wrong with the country? This deserves an ""attaboy"" to the boys in the Petroleum Ministry, indeed.

The Babble in the Ivory Towers
Last week, we looked at how countries manage their macro-economic financial policies. This week, we look at the ongoing European process towards the creation of a single retail banking market.
In a recent discussion paper by Harald Sander of the University of Applied Sciences in Cologne, Germany and Stefanie Kleimeier of the Universiteit Maastricht, The Netherlands, they analyse the current state of retail banking consolidation across Europe. Wholesale financial markets are
getting considerably more integrated rather than the retail financial market, perhaps because the transactions involved in wholesale markets are considerably lesser in number and in a much bigger volume.The authors find that the Euro is already making a seriously positive impact on the retail market integration, but issues like a lack of international arbitrage, a limited pass-through of interest rate changes onto lending rates, and a limited national and international competitive retail banking environment, are still holding back retail integration. This is important
for the variety of banking sectors around the globe, that are expanding on the wings of political and trade integration.

ASEAN, MERCOSUR and NAFTA spring to mind, where the domestic banks are slowly moving into other nations. Nationalism is a difficult barrier to cross indeed. Are you hearing this, SAFTA (South Asian Free Trade Area)?. Domestic banking sectors have to be liberalised and set free within a strong regulatory framework, before they can even think about crossing boundaries. If the domestic sector is not strong, either the banks are subsumed by external competition or are unable to take advantage of the opening of the other markets. Either way, they loose.

The World Babble
The US markets were quiet all week, taking a breath or rather shocked at the terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia, as well as the plunging dollar. The DOW ended up a per cent over the week, while the S&P500 and the NASDAQ ended up nearer to 1.5 per cent over the week.

Deflation is stalking the markets, stoked by the news that the US consumer prices and producer prices index dropped. Is this the dreaded arrival of Japanese style deflation? And will the plunging dollar help hold back the deflationary tide? European markets showed a bit of a rally for the first two days, but started slumping from Wednesday onwards, due to the fears about the exporters getting hit by the strong Euro.

The UK market broke through the 4000 level and closed the week at 4049, the best level achieved since last December. Japan dropped about a per cent, on worries over the strong yen hitting exporters.

But the big action was in the forex markets, with trading floors abuzz with the rumours and rather sharp movements. European markets were heading down as the investors took fright at the strong Euro making life difficult for the European investors. The European auto industry got a hammering, on the back of a downgrade by Goldman Sachs. The situation is getting so bad, that
the prices of auto’s in the UK are no longer significantly different from the continent, thereby knocking a hole in the prospects of the British auto importers.

This weakening of the US dollar is benefiting the US manufacturers with almost all auto firms showing improvements in their share prices. On an overall basis, HSBC estimates that a 10% fall in the USD-EUR rate hits European corporate earnings by 3.5 per cent while increasing the US corporate earnings by 1.5 per cent. Productivity differences? Maybe! 

The major European economies haven’t grown in the first quarter and if the Euro keeps on strengthening, then I would expect the entire year to be a washout and perhaps even head into negative territory. Let us not forget that the USA, unlike Europe, has a far smaller international trade component to its economy, hence the US dollar fall will hurt the Americans far less than the Euro rise will do to the export sector strong European Economy.

The European Central Bank has managed to confuse the market completely with its vague and contradictory pronouncements and the simple fact, that a rate cut is required NOW, is being missed at the rarefied ECB tower in Frankfurt.

The G7 finance ministers are meeting this weekend and I hope we have good news to report on Monday. The Bank of Japan has been intervening steadily in the market, thereby stopping the appreciation of the yen, but it is looking like a one way bet to me. Deflation fears hit the US bond market with a whammy, with the longer dated bonds taking a particularly strong hit.

Oil prices moved up after digesting the Saudi terrorist attacks, the news that Saudi Arabia is cutting production, the news that the stocks held by the developed nations were much lower, Iraqi oil production uncertainty and finally, the domestic unrest following the elections in Nigeria. The biggest worry stalking the markets is a terrorist attack on the oil facilities in
Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the gulf. These facilities are vast and very open to terrorist attack and given a modicum of knowledge, it will be very easy to put a significant portion of production out of the markMinister for Communication and IT, Arun Shourie moaned about the problem with BSNL and MTNL tariff roll-backs. When will the politicians realize that tariffs have to be rationalised? Not soon, I guess. Due to funding constraints, the rural telephony and network upgrade infrastructures will be affected seriously. Disinvestment is still being politically opposed, when will these fellows understand that the government has no business to be in business? The VAT issue has been shelved again. This is a contentious issue and there are good as well as bad points to this situation.

The good points: The country will gain a standardized tax system instead of the rat’s nest of sales tax, octroi tax, local tax, state tax, you-name-it tax. Statistics will be improved and to a large extent, tax evasion can be removed as well. On the other hand, trying to coordinate this massive exercise across all the states is a logistical nightmare and requires local state legislation to implement.
Gold, as is usually the case in troubled times, moved up and hit $356 per ounce before falling back slightly.

On the trade front, the international agencies are getting quite worried about the Doha round. WTO Director-General Supachai Panitchpakdi, IMF Managing Director Horst Köhler and World Bank President James Wolfensohn, in a joint statement at the WTO General Council meeting on coherence on 13 May 2003, appealed to the G-8 leaders to ""provide the political guidance that is
needed to allow the trade negotiations to move forward again before the WTO
Ministerial Conference in Cancun in September"". They particularly aimed their guns on the agricultural issue being critical for the next phase.

The current discussion about the CAP reform in Europe is assuming alarmingly serious significance to the future state of the world economy and French intransigence is holding this entire exercise hostage to their own weird demands. 


","Deflation concerns rose this week as US consumer and producer price indices dropped, sparking fears of a Japanese-style deflationary period. The US dollar's decline has benefited manufacturers, while the Euro's strength negatively impacts European exports. India saw positive industrial growth, with March figures showing a 5.8% increase, amidst global economic challenges. The nation's outsourcing sector continues to thrive, and trade agreements with ASEAN countries and the development of key ports are promising. However, concerns over state governments' slow responses to economic initiatives and geopolitical risks, such as oil price volatility, persist."

The policy aims to “augment integrated, multi-modal, logistics ecosystem for a developed Arunachal Pradesh 2047.”

Logistics have been a focus sector for the country for some time. In 2021, the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan was launched to provide multimodal connectivity infrastructure to economic zones.

In 2022, the National Logistics Policy was launched, with focus on bringing in efficiency and reducing costs. In the 2022 annual report on Logistics Ease Across Different States, Arunachal was ranked in the ‘aspirer’ category, behind the ‘fast mover’ and ‘achiever’ categories, stating a clear need to have a policy intervention for improvements in the logistics sector.

The cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Pema Khandu, took cognisance of the recent improvements in connectivity infrastructure and the growth opportunities it presents.

The policy aims to bring all connectivity projects under one umbrella.

Some of the key projects mentioned in the policy for implementation in a time-bound manner are the Arunachal Frontier Highway from Nafra to Vijaynagar; a special economic zone in Balinong; establishment of nine new industrial areas; upgradation of the Lekhi/Naharlagun interstate bus terminus; warehouse facility for the Itanagar Capital Region in Chimpu; and a logistics hub in Namsai, which is already proposed for financing under the PM Gati Shakti scheme.

The cabinet also reviewed the progress of 12 flagship schemes of the central government, which are aimed to be saturated by March 2024.

The schemes reviewed by the cabinet were soil health card, kisan credit card, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, Jal Jeevan Mission, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, Svamitva, Ayushman Bharat, SvaNidhi, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban).

“I was taken to a bathhouse yesterday... there was a mirror there, I looked at myself -- I am just a horrible skeleton,” Navalny told the court, according to an audio recording released by the independent Dozhd television channel. “I haven’t weighed this much since seventh grade,"" he added, telling his wife Yulia who was in court that he is now allowed a couple spoonfuls of porridge a day.
Another court held a hearing Thursday into a request from prosecutors that Navalny's regional network and his Anti Corruption Foundation (FBK) both be recognised as extremist, equating the organisations with the Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda.
If the request is met, their activities would be banned, putting members and supporters at risk of lengthy jail time. The hearings are set to resume on May 17. The head of the regional network, however, said Thursday it had already been decided to shutter it.

","Alexei Navalny’s political network announced its disbandment as Navalny, appearing gaunt and shaven-headed in court, resumed eating after ending his hunger strike.

Meanwhile, another court is considering prosecutors' request to label Navalny's regional network and Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) as extremist organizations, akin to ISIS and Al-Qaeda.

Moa Jamir
Two all-India indices released within one week in June have designated the quality of education in Nagaland in an unenviable position among its peers and citizens, besides possibly putting those at the helms of affairs in some discomfiture.
The first index was the NITI Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2021 India Index released on June 3, in which the State was ranked 2nd lowest among States and Union Territories (UTs) in the provision of ‘Quality Education.’
The second index, the Performance Grading Index (PGI) released on June 6, slotted Nagaland along with two others states - Arunachal and Chhattisgarh in the bottom-3 and was ranked at Level IV (701 - 750) Grade III out of possible 1000 points.
Since 2018, SDG Index documents and ranks the progress made by States and UTs towards achieving the SDGs; while PGI, introduced 2019, is “a tool to provide insights on the status of school education in States and UTs including key levers that drive their performance and critical areas for improvement.”
In the former, Nagaland’s score declined from 47 in 2019 to 39 in 2020, while in the latter, it was among 10 States/UTs improving the score by 5-10%. While it can be argued that the indices take different indicators to arrive at the final score, inference can be drawn from consistent low ranking on both that something is amiss with the system.
This does not mean that the indices are not free of any data inconsistency. For instance, SDG Index informed that Nagaland had the lowest Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio (ANER) in elementary education at 67.38% among the states; while in the PGI, it scored 10 out of 10 (10/10) and 8/10 for retention rate at the elementary level. The transition rate from elementary till the secondary level is shown to be robust (10/10).
However, both indices were consistent in highlighting the apparent problem at the secondary level - the SDG Index showing annual dropout rate level of class 9-10 at 24%, against the national average of 17.87% while in the PGI, the retention rate was lowest (7/10) for Nagaland.
In terms of learning outcomes, Nagaland scored well in PGI (168 out of 180) while the SDG Index highlighted that percentage of students in grade VIII achieving at least a ‘minimum proficiency level in terms of nationally defined learning outcomes to be attained,’ was among the lowest in the State at 61.0% against the national average of 71.9.  
Both indices highlighted high gender parity in Nagaland with a GPI of 1.11 in the SDG Index while the difference between boys and girls transition rate from upper primary to secondary level in PGI was 10/10.
In term of equity and accessibility, particularly for persons with disability (PWDs), both indices highlighted more or less similar results. For instance, the SDG Index revealed that PWDs (15 years and above) completing at least secondary education was lowest in Nagaland (11.9% against the national average of 19.3%) while it scored the lowly on the provision of accessibility in school for Children with Special Needs (CWSN) in PGI.
PGI showed a high enrollment of CWSN (6-18 years) with a score of 9/10, the percentage of schools having functional CWSN friendly toilets was just 2/10 and 7/10 for schools having ramps. In fact, in the PGI parameter of equity, Nagaland got full scores in all indicators, except those related to CWSN.
Going beyond the comparative analysis, the PGI provided significant insights into where changes can be made apart from those highlighted earlier.  
Nagaland scored lowest in PGI in the category of ‘Infrastructure & Facilities’ with just 101 out of a possible 150. Among others, lack of Integrated Science and Computer labs, vocational education (class IX-XII), as well as failure to deliver uniforms to elementary level students within three months were highlighted.
In terms of governance, the State scored badly in parameters of upper primary schools meeting norms of subject - teacher as per Right to Education Act, filling up of academic positions in state and district academic institutions, days taken to release total Central and State’s share of funds to societies, teachers’ evaluation, transparent teachers transfer etc.
Looking at the key indicators, apart from the dropout rate attributable to various internal and external factors, most are related to governance and infrastructure which can be corrected via adequate policy changes as well as robust monitoring and implementation. To ensure quality education as well as evading annual discomfiture, the State Government would do well by executing a time-bound action plan and course correction.
","Two recent reports ranked Nagaland's education system poorly. The state scored low in both national learning outcomes and infrastructure compared to other Indian states. While there is high gender parity, there are significant gaps in accessibility for students with disabilities. The reports highlight issues with governance, infrastructure, and dropout rates. The author suggests the government create a plan to address these issues and improve the quality of education in Nagaland."
278a76e5b6f9a071318b5fe6a1ef1a03,"[DOC 1] The question about the relevance of the Commonwealth Games was raised before the start of the XXI edition and then again on the concluding day in Gold Coast. Considering the way the 2018 Commonwealth Games (CWG 2018) were dominated by Australia — which ended with 198 medals — four less than the combined tally of the next two (England 136 and India 66), the question will continue to be asked in the near future. 

The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Lousie Martin had defended its relevance at the start of the Games and its CEO David Grevemberg was asked about the legacy on the final day of competition. “These Games have changed the conversation; changed the way we think about the Commonwealth, about the city of Gold Coast, about Queensland, about what it means to be a Commonwealth citizen and that’s the start of a legacy,” Grevemberg said.

With other nations failing to catch up with Australia, and with the standard in most sports — except in swimming where Australia eclipsed its own world record in women’s 4x100m freestyle relay — way below world standard, such questions are justified.
But as the officials point out, these Games are relevant as they help improve the standard of sports in participating countries. Gold Coast set the record for the most gold-winning nations, as well as the widest distribution of medals (43 countries). Five countries won their maiden Commonwealth Games medals here, indicating the progress in what otherwise were the most memorable Commonwealth Games in memory.
India too had a memorable Games, finishing third with 66 medals, their third-best haul that will give its athletes the confidence to emulate their performances in tougher events like the Asian Games, world championships and, perhaps, the Olympics.

Riding on a superlative show by wrestlers, weightlifters, shooters, boxers, shuttlers and table tennis players, India ended with 26 gold, surpassing their 2014 Glasgow tally of 64 medals, including 15 gold. This was India’s third-best haul at the CWG, behind 101 (38 gold) at 2010 New Delhi and 69 (30 gold) at 2002 Manchester.
However, pound for pound this probably was India’s best CWG performance because of the sheer weight of the performances. Unlike 2002 and 2010, the number of events was less and there were fewer medals on offer in shooting, India’s strongpoint. Till 2010, each shooting discipline had a pairs (team) event, which translated into more medals, and India was able to breach the 100-medal mark in New Delhi.
Sport like archery — which offered 24 medals, including eight gold — and tennis, with 15 medals, were part of the 2010 CWG but discontinued in 2014 Glasgow.

What was heartening about India’s Gold Coast performance was the sheer diversity of sports. India triumphed in non-traditional sports like table tennis (nine, including five gold), squash (two silver) and athletics (three, including one gold). Also, the medals were bagged by sportspersons of all age groups — seniors like Mary Kom, Tejaswini Sawant, Sushil Kumar and Achanta Sharath Kamal and youngsters like Manu Bhaker, Anish Bhanwala and Mehuli Ghosh.

Such performance also raises hope of a good showing in the Olympics. And, India can expect some good news from Tokyo in 2020 as Commonwealth Games success has spurred India to improved showing in the Olympics. After their best-ever tally at 2010 CWG, India went on to register their best showing at the 2012 London Olympics, winning six medals (two silver and four bronze).

Will India do the same at the Tokyo Olympics?","The relevance of the Commonwealth Games has been debated, especially after Australia's dominance in the 2018 edition. Despite the lower global competition standards, officials argue that the Games are crucial for raising sports standards in participating countries. The 2018 Games saw a broad distribution of medals, with 43 nations winning, including five first-time medalists. India had a strong showing, finishing third with 66 medals, demonstrating success in both traditional and non-traditional sports. This diverse performance, coupled with historical trends, suggests that India's Commonwealth Games success may lead to promising results at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics."

""We are delighted that our car industry has made significant improvements across all sectors over the last six years and we are confident that we will continue to deliver on this milestone of high-performance and low-cost innovation,"" says Andrew McEthery, Labour MP for Brighton Pavilion.

Mikko Takahashi, chief executive of Nissan Motor UK's British Business Unit, said: ""If all goes as planned, these figures are a strong welcome in recognition of Nissan's hard-working engineering team and its dedicated commitment to improving the lives of all of its workers.

""A significant part of our success lies in our focus on the automotive segment that employs more people each year than the total number of people at Nissan. We are delighted that Nissan shares our vision to create a world-class service and invest huge contributions in our industry in 2017. It is an indication that Nissan will continue to innovate and deliver on our pledge of high-value, high-performance products across all new and exciting sector lines.

In September, we launched our best-selling vehicles, our first new brand of premium fuel-efficient vehicle. With new plans for our UK range next month, Nissan is launching the Fisker ST and the ZX8.

""We have recently increased the number of luxury cars within the UK, which has been a big part of our growth for this sector over the last six years, and we expect that we will continue to increase the number of luxury electric and low-cost hybrids and hybrid SUVs entering the UK in the next 10 years.""

Cannondale, the biggest fuel tax retailer in the UK, said: ""Over the past year, the fuel tax has been an essential component of the UK's energy mix-up. It has now become more important that we keep this country's future economy running strong and that consumers buy their energy from a responsible and transparently priced market.

""We have started the work to increase the amount of fuel tax we levy on British citizens to ensure they get the highest quality fuel for long-term investment.

06cec33ed231022ea840b7bf710aed3d,"[DOC 1]  Demand to scrap export subsidies for meat is gaining momentum
as it’s found skewing the dairy economics where killing animals is turning out
to be more profitable in the short term, than milking for years.
A representation in this regard was made to Sharad Pawar, the Union
agriculture minister who has been at the receiving end for soaring food prices.
The dairy industry, in an elaborate presentation, has explained how the
subsidies help slaughterhouses and thereby impact the milk production in the
country. This, according to it, is a reason behind the recent price hike.
Milk prices rose about 10% in some parts of the country to as much as Rs 35
per litre recently causing unease among households which are already
battling record-high vegetable and grain prices. Many edible commodities are
at record levels due to shortage after the monsoon failed.
“The subsidy encourages dairy owners to discard their animals early,” Subhash
Mandge, member, National Dairy Development Board and president of the
Madhya Pradesh State Co-operative Federation, told ET. “This trend is
observed especially after weaning. As the cost of maintaining buffaloes and
cows after delivery has been going up steadily, many prefer to sell them to
slaughterhouses,” he said.
Currently all cow and buffalo meat exporters get 30% subsidy on exports. That
incentive and the fact that fodder prices have shot through the roof is
provoking farmers to send their cattle to slaughterhouse.
The country’s average milk yield of 917 kg per annum is now ranked a lowly 35th among 44 select countries, though India continues to be the world’s largest milk producer, a position it has clung to for many years. Still, there are
clear signs of worry as farmers in North India, the country’s top milk-producing region, are up against squeezed margins after a 90% rise in fodder
prices between 2006 and 2009.
In contrast, the value of meat exports has doubled in four years to Rs 5,000
crore in 2008-09, according to industry estimates. India shipped around
20,000 animals in 2008-09. “There is a co-relation between rise in meat
exports and the declining number of dairy animals,” Mr Mandge said. The
subsidies end the lives of buffaloes and cows rather early which are normally
milked for 10 years. On an average, buffaloes give 21,600 litres of milk, and
cows it’s 36,000 litres during their lifetime. But there are times when the
farmers have to maintain cattle even if they don’t provide milk.
“But after they are weaned, they become a kind of liability for farmers. During
this period—that could be a year or so—average expenditure on these animals
comes to around Rs 100-125 per head per day. So it means farmers need to
spend average Rs 36,000 before she is ready to give milk again. Instead they
prefer to sell it to slaughter houses for Rs 15,000-20,000 and buy new readyto-milch buffalo or cow by spending around same amount,” Mr Mandge said.
Although the nation’s milk production had nearly doubled between 1992 and
2007, and accounted for about 15% of total world milk production,
uncontrolled trading in meat could jeopardise the position, experts said. “If
the government does not remove policy imbalance, milk soon will become
scarce,” Mr Mandge noted.
","There is a growing demand to abolish export subsidies for meat, which are disrupting dairy economics by making animal slaughter more profitable than milking. The dairy industry presented its case to Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, highlighting that these subsidies benefit slaughterhouses and negatively impact milk production, contributing to recent milk price hikes. Milk prices recently rose by about 10% in some areas, exacerbating the burden of high food costs. Dairy owners are encouraged to sell animals to slaughterhouses due to high maintenance costs and a 30% export subsidy for cow and buffalo meat. India's average milk yield is low, ranked 35th among 44 countries, despite being the largest milk producer. Meat exports have surged, correlating with a decline in dairy animals. Farmers often prefer selling non-milk-producing animals to slaughterhouses, impacting long-term milk supply. Experts warn that without policy adjustments, milk scarcity could become a serious issue."
2e58bb6aec6447d7f2dbe21438af4d8a,"[DOC 1] Expressing solidarity with people of Myanmar amid the military takeover, the Solidarity Committee for Burma Democracy has urged the Military regime to release elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other arrested pro-democracy leaders.
Speaking to media persons at Irawat Bhawan today, the solidarity committee’s chairman and CPI leader L Sotinkumar said the recent military coup in Myanmar was unfortunate and the military regime should return democracy to the people by honouring the November elections held in the country.
The Solidarity Committee for Burma Democracy is with the people of Myanmar. Lakhs of protesters are taking to the streets demanding release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD (National League for Democracy) leaders and return of the democratic Government.
The military should release the NLD leaders and return power to the NLD which had achieved a landslide victory in the November elections, said Sotinkumar.
Sotinkumar said the Solidarity Committee for Burma Democracy was formed after Burma (Myanmar) lost its democracy in 1988. The committee had raised its voice expressing solidarity with the people then. However, the committee remained silent after democracy was restored in Myanmar, he said adding that the committee is yet again forced to raise its voice for democracy in Myanmar again after the recent military coup.
After decades of house arrest during the previous military regime, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest was released in 2010 and after this democracy gradually returned in Myanmar.
Notably, the NLD had won 83 percent of the votes in the November 2020 elections and expanded its seats in the Parliament. And after the military coup recently, Myanmar's Army Chief General Min Aung Hlaing had defended and justified the coup asserting that the elections were fraudulent.
L Sotinkumar said the whole of Myanmar is protesting against the forced military regime and people are marching on the streets for democracy. The military takeover has dishonoured the democratic elections held in November last.
The committee strongly condemns the forced military takeover and arrest of the NLD leaders on unfounded charges. Many have been injured and killed in the protests going on in the country. India as a neighbour should intervene and impose sanctions on the Myanmar military. There is a growing need for people to stand collectively against such dictatorship, Sotinkumar said.
The committee’s convenor, Ksh Shanta and social activist Kh Gyaneshor were also present in the press meet.","The Solidarity Committee for Burma Democracy, led by CPI leader L Sotinkumar, expressed support for Myanmar's pro-democracy movement and urged the military regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi and other arrested leaders.

The committee, which had previously been active in 1988, is raising its voice again following the recent military takeover.

unchanged for the second consecutive meeting.
The MPC since May 2022 hiked rates by 250 bps and has paused since April. On
Thursday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das announced that the Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) unanimously decided to keep the rate unchanged at 6.5 per
cent.
While keeping the interest rate intact, Das noted that headline inflation in India
still remains above the central bank’s target of 4 per cent and is expected to remain so during the rest of the year. Five out of the six members voted to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation
progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth, with Jayanth Varma expressing reservation on the stance.
Remaining vary of the future trajectory of inflation, Das noted that the pace of monetary tightening has slowed in recent
months, but uncertainty remains as inflation continues to rule above targets across the world. Despite hitting an 18-month low of 4.70% in April, analysts do not expect India's inflation to fall to the RBI's 4% medium term target for at least another two years.
""Our goal is to achieve the inflation target of 4% and keeping inflation within the comfort band of 2-6% is not enough,""
Das said.
""This was a ‘Goldilocks’ pause for the RBI. In the run-up to the policy meeting, the economy finds itself in a fortuitous
‘Goldilocks’ macro situation, with better-than-expected Q4 FY23 GDP growth and inflation tracking closer to the RBI’ 
mid-point target of 4%. Our macro view though remains that both, growth and inflation is likely to undershoot the RBI’s
projections in FY24,"" said Aurodeep Nandi, India Economist and Vice President at Nomura.

4. Inflation forecast: CPI inflation is projected at 5.1 per cent for FY24. Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 forecast at 4.6 per cent, 5.2 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively
5. Headline inflation is projected to decline in FY24 from FY23 levels but would still be above the target. The progress of the southwest monsoon remains critical in this regard
6. The monsoon forecast by IMD augurs well for Kharif crops but the distribution of monsoon needs to be monitored.
Crude oil prices have eased, but the outlook is uncertain
7. Real GDP forecast: GDP growth for FY24 is 6.5 per cent. Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 at 8.0 per cent, 6.5 per cent, 6.0 per cent, and 5.7 per cent respectively
8. Real GDP growth in 2022-23, on the other hand, turned out to be stronger than anticipated and is holding up well 9. The policy repo rate has been increased by 250 basis points since May 2022 and is still working its way through the system. Its fuller effects will be seen in the coming months
10. The average system liquidity, however, is still in surplus mode and could increase as ₹2,000 banknotes get deposited in the banks

pause. System liquidity is the one parameter which will need monitoring,"" said Saugata Bhattacharya, Chief Economist, Axis Bank.
RBI Governor Das said that RuPay Prepaid Forex cards will be issued by banks in India for use at ATMs, PoS machinesand online merchants overseas. RuPay Debit, Credit, and Prepaid Cards will be enabled for issuance in foreign jurisdictions, which can be used internationally, including in India.
RBI has proposed the expansion of the scope of e-RUPI vouchers by permitting non-bank PPI issuers to issue them. It has also been proposed to enable the issuance of e-RUPI vouchers on behalf of individuals.
The central bank proposed that all SCBs, ex-small finance banks, be able to set their own limits for borrowing in Call and

0b8a2985fcbe71d5d5108a6478ee90d8,"[DOC 1] The fall of Byju's was marked by a number of issues including overambitious acquisitions, increasing losses, piling debts, legal disputes, and so on
Troubled edtech major Byju's, which was once an investor's favourite , saw its valuation plummet by a staggering 86% from $22 billion to less than $3 billion in just the span of one year.

Byju's owner Byju Raveendran photo is seen on his company web page in this illustration.
The following are the five main reasons for the downfall of Byju's.

1) Expansion by acquisition spree
Byju's rembarked on an acquisition spree of both domestic as well as international competitors right after the pandemic-induced online learning boom, in a quest to expand their offerings.

Companies it snapped up included WhiteHat Jr. and Great Learning. The WhiteHat Jr acquisition in itself was worth around a billion dollars.

This led to Byju's amassing debts adding up to well over $1.2 billion, far exceeding its ability to generate revenues to repay them.

2) Post-pandemic edtech slowdown
The entire edtech boom slowed down right after the pandemic got over and students returned to classrooms. Since Byju's core offering was online learning, this severely impacted its growth potential and led to increased losses.

For example, its 2021-22 financial statements revealed a loss of ₹5,592 crore, while it was a loss of ₹2,428 crore during the previous year.

3) Piling debts
While previously mentioned that one of the primary contributors to the company's debts was acquisitions, another reason was expensive marketing campaigns which featured high-profile sponsorships and celebrity endorsements. This when combined with the post-pandemic slowdown resulted in mounting debts.

4) Legal disputes
Byju's ended up getting sued by its creditors for defaulting on loan payments, which also triggered insolvency proceedings.

The most prominent legal disputes are between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and US-based loan administrator Glas Trust, both of which have been fighting to get preference of repayment. Other vendors are part of the picture too.

5) Transparency issues and internal struggles
Byju's also delayed its 2021-22 financial reports by nearly a year which eroded investor confidence by a lot. Moreover, its auditor and key executives resigned around the same time as well.

It also had internal issues. Reports emerged of a highly pressured sales culture with unrealistic targets and allegations of aggressive tactics, harassment, and even misrepresentation of products, which increased the employee turnover.

And this also reflected in the treatment of customers, with several parents reporting being pressured to purchase subscriptions beyond their point of affordability.","Byju's, once valued at $22 billion, plummeted to under $3 billion due to overambitious acquisitions, post-pandemic edtech slowdown, piling debts from marketing and loans, legal disputes with creditors, and internal struggles over transparency and sales culture. These issues culminated in significant financial losses and eroded investor confidence."

A fortnight ago, the variant was present in just 2% of the samples, underlining its rapid spread in the community within days.Despite Omicronâs rise, only 6% had required hospitalisation and vaccination seemed to be effective in curbing severe Covid.On Friday, the state reported four Omicron cases, taking the overall count to 454.The findings of the seventh genome sequencing by BMC is likely to trigger changes in the quarantine and isolation norms of Omicron suspects.

The only death reported from the cohort of 282 was of a 60-year-old man who was infected by a Delta derivative. The man also had a history of diabetes and hypertension and had taken the first dose.DrSandeep Juneja, dean of TIFRâs school of technology and computer science, tweeted that since these samples were from December 21-22, the ratio of Omicron cases could be upwards of 95% by now. The BMC also analysed all 156 Omicron cases and found that only nine were hospitalised, but none had any major symptoms. Only 17 out of 282 people needed hospitalisation. Of the 17, three had taken only one dose and 10 had taken both doses. From the 282 cohort, 81 people were unvaccinated, but even among them, only four needed hospitalisation.

7c95f22fb507a3402391b8c6009a3ad4,"[DOC 1] The Maratha, Jat and Patidar agitations for reservation underline the need for a comprehensive quota policy in our country

The flavour of the season is the demand for quotas. From the Jats in Haryana to the Patidars in Gujarat to the Kapus in Andhra Pradesh. The Marathas are the latest one to demand reservation. They have resorted to peaceful silent marches, but have threatened to escalate that soon. Even as the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP Government in Maharashtra is struggling to face the unprecedented silent marches, there is unrest in the OBCs, Muslims and Dalits.

The gruesome rape and murder of a young Maratha girl by four Dalit men in the Kopardi village of Ahmednagar district in July, triggered the protest. Since then, the Maratha uprising has picked up pace without the presence of politicians. However, powerful Maratha leaders, including Sharad Pawar and Ashok Chavan, have given their tacit support to the silent movement.

The Marathas have three demands. First, reservation for Marathas. Second, modification of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Third, punishment to the Kopardi rape accused. Under the said Act, stringent punishment including a prison sentence is given to those who hurt the sentiments of a Dalit, through actions or words, or both. The Marathas claim that this Act is being misused.

The ‘Muk Morcha’ is picking up since the first rally in Aurangabad district on August 10. The novelty is that almost every rally since then (40 such rallies have been taken out) is led by women and school-going girls carrying placards demanding justice for the victim. They account for almost 30 per cent of the protesters. Politicians are keeping away, avoiding responsibility in case the movement becomes a failure.

The demand for quota dates back to the 1980s, but picked up pace in 2008, when the then Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, lent tacit supported to the demand made by their respective parties’ Maratha legislators ahead of the 2009 polls. In 2014, the Congress-NCP Government, led by Prithviraj Chavan, passed a law providing for 16 per cent reservation to Marathas in education and jobs to appease them. However, in a year, the Bombay High Court scrapped the quota, stating that the community is neither socially nor educationally backward. The final order is pending.

The Fadnavis Government is facing a Catch-22 situation. The Marathas account for 34 per cent of the population and have played a dominant role in the socio-economic and political ethos of the State. They have adequate representation (33 per cent) in the present Assembly and 13 of the 18 Chief Ministers of the State were from this community. The creamy layer among them holds land, money, political power, educational institutions and industries. They control the rural economy through their hold on cooperative bodies, including banks. 

Interestingly, while OBCs and other castes have made progress in education, the Marathas have not. 

Politically, the agitation has shaken the ruling BJP- Sena combine. The Chief Minister, who is a Brahmin, understands that caste politics can work against him as Brahmins comprises only 3.5 per cent of the State’s population. Already there are speculations that these rallies are a ploy to ensure his ouster. The BJP did well by getting 24 per cent of the Maratha votes in 2014 Assembly polls.

Chief Minister Fadnavis understands that the demands of the community are hard to meet. The major issue is how to accommodate them within the stipulated limit without annoying other castes. On the other hand, its coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, is openly siding with the Marathas. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has even demanded a special session to discuss the Act.

like in the BJP, Marathas in the Congress and its off-shoot, the NCP, are equally restless. Both the parties lost their Maratha base in the recent Assembly poll and also fear a rout in the forthcoming local bodies polls.

The recent mobilisation of Marathas is opening up other fronts. It has pitted them against the Dalits. The two have had an uneasy relationship for decades. There is growing resentment among the young Marathas that the Atrocities Act empowers the Dalits to act against the upper caste. The BJP is caught in the middle because the Dalits supported the BJP in the Assembly poll.

The time has come to review the reservation policy and find other ways of meeting genuine demands.

","The Maratha, Jat, and Patidar agitations for reservation highlight the ongoing demand for comprehensive quota policies in India. Triggered by incidents like the Kopardi rape and murder case, Marathas are demanding reservation, modification of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, and justice for the victim. Led mostly by women and schoolgirls, the protests have seen significant mobilization but politicians have largely kept their distance. Historically, the demand for quotas dates back to the 1980s, gaining traction in recent years with legislative attempts and subsequent legal challenges. The issue poses a challenge for the Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government, navigating caste dynamics and political repercussions while balancing competing interests within the state's diverse population.

government to ascertain who will be categorized as urban poor
living below poverty line (BPL).
A bench of Acting Chief Justice A S Dave and Justice J B Pardiwala
ordered last week for providing at the earliest the details of criteria
for the purpose. Before the HC, the state government submitted
that it had written to the Centre in September 2015 to give
“guidelines/instructions for determination/identification of the
urban poor”.
The secretary of ministry of housing & urban poverty alleviation was requested to provide the parameters for
scoring pattern of deprivation/urban poor. This would help crystallize the list of urban poor so that benefits of
various schemes can be extended to them. The state government submitted before the court that it was
awaiting details from the Centre.
HC had ordered completion of survey
On Friday, the Centre’s counsel assured the court that the “needful shall be done in this regard at the earliest”.
After recording the undertaking, the HC disposed the application filed by Congress leader Jawahar Chavda three years ago, when the survey of the poor in Junagadh town could not by undertaken for issuance of BPL cards.
In 2014, Congress leader Jawahar Chavda had filed a PIL in the Gujarat high court after he came to know that the
state government had stalled the survey of the poor in Junagadh district.
The survey was undertaken for issuance of BPL cards.
Following the intervention by the high court, the survey work resumed.
The HC had ordered completion of survey and issuance of BPL cards to all those identified below the poverty line.
A year later, the petitioner approached the HC again by filing another application and complained that the
survey was completed in rural areas, but it did not take place in urban area. The issue was pending before the HC
since then.
Upon the HC’s query, the Centre promised that it would soon provide the guidelines for identification of people in
the BPL category from urban area.","The Gujarat High Court has directed the Central government to provide guidelines and parameters to the state government for ascertaining who will be categorized as urban poor living below the poverty line (BPL).

5eb9d9602b7832c69d3ec01a0851901d,"[DOC 1] On December 4, 2023, more than 50% of the buildings were flooded at Varadharajapuram on the Outer Ring Road, south-west of the core city. Among them were a public library, a fair price shop and an e-seva centre. Library books were damaged; the essential items meant for public distribution were dumped in a pit. Cyclone Michaung had eroded roads, damaged infrastructure, flooded 1,500 homes, affecting the lives and livelihood of about 20,000 residents. One month after the cyclone, residents have started a campaign to reconstruct the damaged infrastructure, demanding that the government make the area flood-resilient. This initiative sets an example for other residents, as various departments have started discussing resilient reconstruction projects after the floods in the Chennai Metropolitan Area.
V. Rajasekaran, president of the Federation of Varadharajapuram Welfare Associations, said the residents had resolved to campaign for reconstruction of infrastructure to improve resilience. “We met the IIT representative on the Tiruppugazh committee on flood mitigation on January 11, requesting a suggestion for an alternative route to divert water from the Chembarambakkam lake. We demanded desilting of the lake; construction of a retaining wall along the Adyar; an increase in the height of the existing wall by 4 feet; and setting up of sewage treatment plants along the river. We demanded cement concrete roads, and redesigning of the Outer Ring Road bridge across the Adyar. We need more funds for roads, parks, and drains.” 
Seven weeks after the floods at Thoraipakkam in ward 193 of the Greater Chennai Corporation, residents conducted an audit of the damaged infrastructure, pointing to the delay in repairing minor damage. A. Francis, president of the Federation of Thoraipakkam Residents’ Welfare Associations, said the play area in the Anand Nagar Park had been out of bounds for children for 54 days because of the delay in removal of slush accumulated during the floods. “Senior citizens have stopped visiting the park after the floods,” he said. Many residents of the area around the Pallikaranai marsh, in the vicinity of the Information Technology Corridor, have demanded resilient reconstruction projects based on public consultations. 
Starting January 25, area sabha meetings are held in 2,000 localities, covering 426 square kilometres of the Chennai Corporation and other local bodies in the Chennai Metropolitan Area. Residents want to discuss resilient reconstruction projects at these meetings. Even as funds for many of the resilient reconstruction projects have not been sanctioned yet, Corporation officials said work on civic infrastructure was expected to be taken up in a few weeks with the civic body’s own resources. External funding for long-term projects is expected to be sanctioned in a few months. Corporation Commissioner J. Radhakrishnan has ordered officials to restore roads, drains, and other infrastructure damaged in the floods before implementing major projects to improve resilience. 
“We will construct shutter-cum-pumping arrangements at 150 locations to mitigate flooding,” said Corporation Chief Engineer S. Rajendiran. When Gagandeep Singh Bedi was the Commissioner, the Corporation had implemented such projects to successfully mitigate flooding, based on the themes of Singara Chennai 2.0 that intends to give priority to ecology, culture, lifestyle, and infrastructure. The purpose of Singara Chennai 2.0, launched in 2021 by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, was to redesign and redevelop Chennai as a global destination for liveability and sustainability. After Cyclone Michaung, residents have demanded changes in the projects proposed on the basis of the Singara Chennai 2.0 themes — city beautification; heritage; culture and arts; accessibility and inclusivity; education, health, and wellness; transport and mobility; e-governance and innovation; and rethinking urban spaces. 
The residents at the area sabha meetings have been demanding projects for resilient reconstruction. For instance, the tussle between the residents’ associations and the Corporation on the issue of the eco-park on 100 acres of the Perungudi dump in the Pallikaranai marsh has intensified after the cyclone. While the Corporation has adopted the ‘urban forestry concept with wetland and mounds’ to assuage the residents’ fears about flood mitigation, residents have demanded the removal of all encroachments in the marsh and its restoration. 
“Residents were vocal in demanding the complete restoration of the Pallikaranai marsh and Velachery lake at the area sabha meeting held on January 25,” said S. Kumararaja, of Save Pallikaranai Marshland. “The entire Pallikaranai marsh should be declared a protected area under the Forest Act. All the legal and illegal encroachments should be removed from the marsh, as ordered by the National Green Tribunal,” he said. 
A successful implementation of the eco-park project at the Perungudi dump depends on the outcome of a public consultation to be held in a few weeks. Even as the Corporation has claimed that the project would restore the ecological balance of the Pallikaranai marsh and the park would serve as a regional biosphere, residents have rejected the idea, demanding that the entire marsh be restored to prevent floods in the vicinity of the IT Corridor. 
At ‘Chennai Rains and Waterlogging Datajam-2024’, held on January 8, participants suggested that the government publish all land records to ensure no marsh and waterbodies are encroached upon or used for infrastructure development; conduct flood-mapping; and shift people living in flood-prone areas to safer zones. 
Residents of the other local bodies in the Chennai Metropolitan Area have sought flood mitigation projects such as construction of ‘shutter-cum-pumping arrangement’ along waterways, canals, and drains. They have demanded reconstruction of hospitals, schools, parks, and Amma canteens damaged during the southeast monsoon and Cyclone Michaung. Unusually, Chennai received a huge amount of rain during the southeast monsoon of 2023. K. Dhana Sekaran, chairman, Chennai Corporation Standing Committee (Accounts), said the civic body started issuing tenders for reconstruction of damaged schools in areas like Nesapakkam, after shifting students to other schools. “The school at Nesapakkam was damaged in frequent spells of rain in 2023 before the cyclone. All the students have been shifted to other schools. The reconstruction will start soon,” he said. 
M. Harish, a resident of Srinivasa Nagar at Ullagaram-Puzhuthivakkam, says improvements to the concrete side-walls of Veerangal Odai and closure of small channels created for rainwater to drain from the low-level localities of Srinivasa Nagar into the Odai would help to mitigate floods. 
Residents pointed out that several pipes laid beneath the Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road for evacuating rainwater from the north to the south of the marsh had been blocked with concrete debris. “If they had been desilted properly, the rainwater would have flowed to the southern side and finally into the Buckingham Canal. A canal should be built within the marsh at the northern side near the Velachery railway station,” a resident added. 
Corporation officials said the work was expected to resume shortly on storm water drains in residential areas of the Kosasthalaiyar basin in north Chennai and the Kovalam basin in south Chennai. The work on relaying of 4,000 roads is expected to be taken up shortly. 
Roads to a length of 2,587.88 km, belonging to the Highways Department, have been damaged at 651 locations in the impact of Cyclone Michaung in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, and Chengalpattu districts, officials said. “Many roads have taken a hit owing to water-logging and incessant rain. The top-wearing coat of the roads has been washed away or shrunk and vehicles go on the damaged surfaces. Potholes have also developed. The repairs need to be done urgently,” said an official. The restoration cost of the highways is pegged at ₹1,500 crore. 
Stressing the need for futuristic interventions for resilient reconstruction, Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) Special Officer I. Jeyakumar said the recommendations from the JICA-funded flood mapping by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) would be helpful in resilient reconstruction of transport infrastructure in the Chennai Metropolitan Area, which has more than 15 million residents. 
The Water Resources Department (WRD) has started repairing the damage caused during the floods. It had sought ₹30 crore for repairs to the damaged structures in waterbodies and the breached waterways. Intense rain in December last year caused damage to major reservoirs in Red Hills and Cholavaram and weakened the bunds of waterbodies, including those at Narayanapuram, Orathur, and Sekkadu. The vulnerable stretches of waterways like the Adyar, the Kosasthalaiyar, and the Araniyar had breached during the floods. 
Officials said work was carried out to fix the problems immediately as part of the flood-relief measures. Funds have been partially sanctioned for the projects carried out recently. The WRD has chalked out proposals for restoration of the waterbodies and waterways in Chennai and neighbouring districts. A government order is expected to be issued in a few days approving projects worth ₹350 crore to permanently restore the flood-affected waterbodies and stretches of rivers. 
Sewers and water pipelines were also severely affected during the torrential rain. The water agency had submitted a report to the Central team that had visited the city to assess the damage. It had sought ₹69 crore to repair the waterlines and the sewers. The sewers had carried more than double the normal load of 540 million litres a day of sewage during the intense rainfall. This led to the collapse of the collection system and pipe bursts at various locations. Sewers covering a distance of nearly 72,000 metres were flushed and nearly 5,630 damaged maintenance holes were replaced. Pipelines that were dislocated were repaired and various facilities were dewatered. Water is supplied through other routes in some areas until the old lines are repaired. 
Chennai Metro Rail Limited and the Chennai Corporation have started identifying damage to the old arch drains at Metro Rail construction sites for construction of new drains. 
K. Kumar, visiting faculty member at the School of Architecture and Planning, Anna University, and former Chief Planner, CMDA, said capital asset management after resilient reconstruction was a vital aspect of urban development planning and management. 
“Urban infrastructure such as paved road networks, bridges, and flyovers underperform during floods if these assets aren’t kept in good fettle. For example, a paved road would deteriorate in the absence of storm water drains that are inseparable elements of urban roads. Good to see that the Chennai Corporation has identified road links that don’t have the storm water drains and is providing them on priority. A cambered road with a well maintained storm water drain will not be a liability but an asset during monsoon floods. A stagnant water sheet can render the throughput of even a six-lane road to just two-lane capacity, resulting in avoidable traffic snarls. In the same way, canals and rivers can discharge flood excesses effectively if the flood plains are kept clear of any impediment,” he said. 
“Those residents who are essentially encroachments in the river bed or flood plains affected by the floods can be accommodated in makeshift camps or disaster management shelters temporarily and the area can be improved by land readjustment design or tenemental buildings for rehabilitating them back. The focus of stocktake meetings after floods mustn’t be limited to picking and choosing hurriedly some quick-fix solutions to please the political bosses but to go to the root of the malaise and remedy it so that recurrence of the predicament is minimised, if not eliminated,” he said.

As the announcement of the election schedule is likely to be made in the month of February 2024, looking at the current situation, there could be a tug of war for candidatures for the two seats in the state in major political parties like Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).North Goa Lok Sabha seat, which has been a stronghold of the ruling BJP for the last two and half decades, could see a new twist as more aspirants such as former MLA Dayanand Sopte and Dilip Parulekar have come out openly claiming ticket for the seat.

Political observers say that though the BJP is known for being a disciplined party, perhaps for the first time in recent years, some of the former legislators have openly spoken about retirement of senior leader Shripad Naik, a five-time MP.","With the Lok Sabha elections approaching in just three months, there is uncertainty within major political parties in Goa regarding candidature for the two seats in the state. The North Goa Lok Sabha seat, traditionally held by the ruling BJP, may witness a shift as aspirants like former MLA Dayanand Sopte and Dilip Parulekar vie for the ticket. This development suggests a potential challenge to senior leader Shripad Naik, who has held the seat for five consecutive terms.

1f9033e173444c111a714a0e0ac97a56,"[DOC 1] Joshimath : Protests erupted in Joshimath as the administration moved to demolish unstable buildings, including two precariously standing hotels, even as more structures developed cracks due to land subsidence that has threatened settlements in much of the hill town.

At least 45 more buildings were discovered with cracks, taking the total number of such structures to 723, with many possibly needing to be torn down.

But the first of such demolitions, of buildings marked with a red X, ran into trouble on Tuesday as residents held demonstrations over compensation.

The owner of hotel Malari Inn, which is among the first set to be demolished, threatened to self-immolate if the authorities “forcefully try to demolish his property”.

Thakur Singh Rana, the Malari Inn owner, told HT, “I will kill myself by setting myself on fire if the authorities try to demolish my hotel. The authorities should first give us adequate compensation. It’s not just about me, but the people of the whole Joshimath. I am fighting for their rights.”

Malari Inn and Mount View, two adjacent hotels, have begun leaning towards each other dangerously, posing a threat to human settlements around them. The Uttarakhand government on Monday directed the razing of unstable structures, starting with these two buildings.

But, as State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) personnel along with heavy machinery reached the site, Singh and other protestors lay in the way.

The protesters said there was no clarity on how people whose properties were to be demolished will be compensated.

Matbir Singh, one of the protesters, whose homes are located downhill from Malari Inn, said: “First the authorities should give them notice, then conduct financial assessment and make compensation accordingly before carrying out demolition.”

Bijaya, another protestor who identified using just one name, said: “Why are authorities not paying the compensation before demolition of unsafe properties? Today they are destroying the hotel without giving compensation to the hotel owner, tomorrow they will do the same with us.”

A third protester, Ukha Rawat, said: “I have five kids and taking care of them on my own. My husband died many years ago. If they demolish my house without compensation, where will I go?”

The authorities tried to persuade protesters but they remained at the spot till late on Tuesday.

Singh later claimed he was sent an estimate of ₹2.92 crore (worth of loss) and asked by the sub-divisional magistrate to sign it. “How can I sign it? I spent ₹6-7 crore on upgrading the hotel by 2011. I am with the state government so far as the safety of people is concerned but I don’t agree with the amount being offered to me as compensation,” he said.

Mount View owner Lalmani Semwal expressed similar sentiments. “It is like slaying a child one has reared through years of hard work in front of its parent.”

Secretary, Disaster Management, Ranjit Sinha told reporters that the Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee has been roped in by the state government for the demolition.

As many as 131 families have been shifted to the temporary relief centres so far with 37 more evacuated on Tuesday. There are 86 houses in the area demarcated as an unsafe zone.

The National Crisis Management Committee reviewed the situation in Joshimath and stressed that the immediate priority should be to ensure the complete and safe evacuation of all residents in the affected zone.","In Joshimath, protests erupted as authorities moved to demolish unstable buildings, including hotels, amid increasing cracks due to land subsidence. At least 45 more buildings were found damaged, totaling 723, raising concerns of further demolitions. The owner of Malari Inn threatened self-immolation over inadequate compensation, leading to demonstrations blocking demolition. Protesters demanded clarity and fair compensation before demolition, expressing fears of homelessness. Authorities attempted persuasion but faced resistance.

Despite protests, PMC to go ahead with metro
TNN | May 20, 2010, 04.52 AM IST
PUNE: Notwithstanding the objections raised against the proposed elevated metro route from Vanaz to Ramwadi, the ruling parties in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Wednesday categorically stated that the general body (GB) will approve the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) plan for an elevated metro without any amendments.
The plan of building a metro railway on the proposed 14.925 km metro corridor from Vanaz to Ramwadi is on the GB agenda and was to be taken up on Wednesday. However, the GB was adjourned after paying homage to former vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. The opposition parties, including the BJP and the Shiv Sena, demanded that the metro proposal should be postponed by a month. However, the ruling NCP decided to take up the matter on June 5.
""We are firm on our stand that the metro proposal will be approved by the GB without any amendments. The DMRC has tabled a detailed proposal and all parties have already approved it in the standing committee. The opposition parties wanted some time to discuss the proposal with their leaders and hence we have decided to take up the matter on June 5,"" senior NCP member and leader of the house in the PMC, Nilesh Nikam, said.
Nikam said that the objections raised by some groups will be taken into consideration. ""We will forward these objections to the DMRC and get responses. We will take everyone into confidence. However, there will be no amendment in the DPR at this stage and the metro proposal will be approved in its existing form,"" Nikam said.

Arvind Shinde, Congress leader and standing committee chairman, stated, ""The Congress supports the metro project and we will go ahead with the proposed elevated metro as suggested by the DMRC. We are confident that the plan will be approved unanimously next month.""
Some organisations, including the Pune Metro Jagruti Abhiyaan (PMJA), the Pune Technical Coalition Committee (PTCC) and Janwani, on Wednesday held an agitation at the PMC gates, demanding that the proposal should not be approved in its present form.

The DMRC has suggested execution of the project on two corridors. The first corridor runs from the PCMC building to Swargate, while the second from Vanaz to Ramwadi. The first corridor will run within both PMC and PCMC limits. PMC members have alleged that the PCMC is dragging its feet on the project and the PMC should go ahead with the phase II corridor running only within its limits.

Phase II will cost Rs 2,281 (including taxes), of which the PMC will contribute 10%, the state and the Centre will pitch in 40% and the rest will come from private players.

The standing committee has already resolved that the metro corridor be extended to Kharadi/Chandannagar as per convenience and availability of funds. It also decided to appoint a special officer to co-ordinate the project.

Both of them have decisively won seven out of the 11 states that held primaries on the so-called Super Tuesday  when more such contests are held than any other day in the electoral contest. Super Tuesday is generally the most decisive milestone in the road that eventually takes the US to its presidential election day in November.Yet, of the two, Ms Clinton is by far the more decisive. This is largely because the Democratic race is already down to just two candidates. Super Tuesday showed that her support among minority voters has remained intact. Bernie Sanders has been undone by his inability to break into the black and Hispanic vote. Mr Trump is fighting in a more crowded field and, theoretically, if all the votes of the other Republican candidates were to coalesce around a single individual that person would easily sweep the remaining primaries. But, for the time being, the four other candidates insist they will remain in the race. Definitely, the two other leading candidates, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, have little reason to drop out at this point. The Republican race will remain volatile for at least another month. The Democratic one is now an academic exercise.Ms Clinton will now increasingly have to face the voter disaffection that allowed two mavericks, an independent socialist like Mr Sanders and a loud-mouthed real estate developer like Mr Trump, to surprise pundits and pollsters alike. These two candidates have proven to be lightning rods for blue collar workers and youth who have turned against establishment politics. Ms Clinton has terribly negative ratings among such groups. Her support base remains people of colour, the elderly and professional suburban whites. Winning over the other segments of society will be crucial to her chances of victory  but it is not yet certain she has the ability to bridge that gap. That is why national-level matchup polls between her and Mr Trump put her only a few points ahead. Increasingly for the Democrats this is going to be about how to sell Ms Clinton to an unusually polarised and cynical American electorate. That process has just begun and may prove more difficult than anyone had expected, least of all Ms Clinton herself.","Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have emerged as frontrunners in their respective parties after Super Tuesday results. Clinton faces less competition within the Democrats but needs to appeal to broader groups beyond her current base. Trump's Republican race remains volatile, while Clinton will need to address voter disaffection to secure victory. The general election is expected to be close and hinge on how each candidate can appeal to a polarized electorate. (69 words)"

335027602c0efa2562d80f2de9c4f847,"[DOC 1] HYDERABAD: In a major setback to Indian plans, Virat Kohli has withdrawn from the first two matches of the five-Test series against England due to “personal reasons”. The Indian board will name a replacement soon, with the first Test beginning here on Jan 25.

“Virat has spoken to captain Rohit Sharma, the team management and the selectors and has emphasised that while representing the country has always been his top priority, certain personal situations demand his presence and undivided attention,” the BCCI said in a statement on Monday.

Virat Kohli withdraws from first two England Tests: BCCI
Kohli’s withdrawal opens up a slot in the middle order and the BCCI is optimistic the squad will front up to the challenge. “The BCCI respects his decision and the board and team management has extended its support to the star batter and is confident in the abilities of the remaining squad members to step up and deliver commendable performances in the Test series.

“The BCCI requests the media and fans to respect Virat Kohli’s privacy during this time and refrain from speculating on the nature of his personal reasons,” the statement added.
In a rich vein of form during the World Cup, where he had piled up 765 runs in 11 ODI World Cup matches for runners-up India last year, Kohli missed the white-ball leg of the South African tour in 2023 and the opening T20I against Afghanistan in Mohali.


Already without Mohammed Shami, who is recovering from an ankle injury, Kohli’s absence — he has 8,848 runs including 29 centuries and an average of over 49 in 113 Tests — will upset India’s calculations in a series likely to be dominated by the spinners.

The script in this series is unlikely to be different from the last two in 2016-17 and 2020-21, when the spinners ruled the roost with 135 wickets.
Offie Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick with 60 scalps in the two series while Ravindra Jadeja claimed 26 wickets in the 2016-17 series.

Axar Patel, who earned his maiden Test cap in 2021, made the most of Jadeja’s absence to wreck England on turners in Chennai and Ahmedabad.

Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav will join the trio — India are likely to go in with three spinners — as they look to rattle the England middle order, which will bank heavily on the experience of former skipper Joe Root.


The Yorkshireman has been on three tours of India and Ashwin, the most successful Indian spinner against England in home Tests, will look to add to his tally of 74 sticks from three series — 14 in 2012-13, 28 in 2016-17 and 32 in 2020-21.


The offie has had Ben Stokes’ number nine times, opener Ben Duckett thrice. He has also proved his prowess against the right-handers, dismissing Root and Ollie Pope four times each and Jonny Bairstow thrice. With 337 wickets in India against all countries, Ashwin needs 14 more to eclipse Anil Kumble’s tally of 350 — the most wickets by a spinner in India.

Jadeja and Axar, who will vie for a spot with Kuldeep, have proved to be ideal foil for Ashwin and England will sorely miss Harry Brook. The 24-yearold, who scored four centuries in 12 Tests, has knowledge of local conditions, having played for Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2023, and was expected to be in the XI. Dan Lawrence, who last played a Test in 2022, has been named as Brook’s replacement.


Given his late arrival, England may field both the wicketkeepers — Bairstow and Ben Foakes — in the first Test. The teams had intense sessions at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Monday. While the Indian team hit the ground in the morning, the Englishmen trained in the afternoon.","Virat Kohli has decided to withdraw from the first two matches of India's upcoming five-Test series against England due to personal reasons, as confirmed by the BCCI. Kohli, who communicated his decision to captain Rohit Sharma, team management, and selectors, emphasized the need to prioritize personal matters requiring his full attention. The BCCI respects his decision and is confident in the abilities of the remaining squad members to perform well in his absence. They have urged media and fans to respect Kohli's privacy during this period. His absence, alongside Mohammed Shami's injury, poses challenges for India in a series expected to heavily feature spinners, with players like Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel crucial to India's strategy."

The Muslim petitioners argued that their plea in the Krishna Janmabhoomi case was pending in the Supreme Court.

Following this, the High Court decided to reserve its order.

Over a dozen petitions are pending before the High Court regarding the Eidgah complex, with the Hindu side claiming that the mosque was constructed by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb by demolishing a temple on 13.37 acres of Lord Krishna's birthplace.Lucknow: Construction of a proposed mosque in Ayodhya mandated by the Supreme Court in its Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case verdict is expected to begin in May, people associated with the project have said. The Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation Trust, which is tasked with building the mosque in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur, also intends to appoint in-charges in different states starting in February to raise funds.

Settling a fractious issue that goes back more than a century, the Supreme Court in a historic verdict on November 9, 2019, backed the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and ruled that an alternative plot be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town.

The construction of the mosque is yet to begin even as the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple is expected to take place on January 22, 2024. Chief trustee of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation Zufar Farooqui said, “The final design of the mosque is likely to be ready by mid-February and it will then go for administrative approval. The site office will be set up in the complex in February.”

“It is expected that we will be in a position to start construction of the mosque in May next year,” Farooqui, who is also the chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, told PTI. Farooqui said the construction of the Mohammad Bin Abdullah Ayodhya Mosque is getting delayed due to the fresh formalities after “drastic” changes were made in the design of the mosque and financial constraints.","The Allahabad High Court has reserved its order on the survey of the Shahi Eidgah mosque near the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple complex in Mathura.

Biden issued a proclamation on Friday restricting travel from India starting on May 4. Certain categories of students, academics, journalists and individuals have been exempted from the ban, the US State Department said.

US nationals, those having green cards, their noncitizen spouses and children below 21 years of age, are among the various categories exempted from the restrictions. The new travel restrictions have been imposed for an indefinite period and will require another presidential proclamation to end it.

“I have determined that it is in the interests of the US to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into America, as non-immigrants, of non-citizens of the US who were physically present within India during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the

US,” says the proclamation signed by Biden on Friday.

The decision has been taken at the recommendation of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, which determined India is experiencing widespread, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

After reviewing the public health situation within India, the CDC has concluded that proactive measures are required to protect the nation’s public health from travellers entering the US from that jurisdiction, he said.

According to the State Department, the travel ban exemption to certain categories is in line with a similar exemption that the US has granted to some categories of travellers from Brazil, China, Iran and or South Africa.

Students seeking to commence studies in the fall, academics, journalists and individuals who provide critical infrastructure support in countries affected by a geographic Covid-19 restriction may qualify for the exception, it said.

This includes qualified applicants who have been present in India, Brazil, China, Iran, or South Africa, it added.

As always, visa applicants should check the website of the nearest embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information about visa appointment availability, the State Department said.

Sitharaman’s response to queries of reporters here came in the backdrop of state political parties protesting the conduct of recent Postal department exams in English and Hindi only.

They had alleged that it was a form of “Hindi imposition” in Tamil Nadu, which incidentally had witnessed a successful anti-Hindi agitation in the 1960s spearheaded by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.

One can question the government if such things were done knowingly or not, but should not jump to a conclusion that it was imposition of the language, she said.

“Central government does not do Hindi imposition,” she asserted.

“If somewhere, at an administrative level, if something happens, don’t come to a conclusion that it is imposition. Definitely there is no imposition (of Hindi). We are also involved in development of Tamil,” she said.

Festive offer
As part of the Centre’s ‘EK Bharat Shreshta Bharat’ scheme, efforts have been made to popularise Tamil in northern states of the country, she added.

“There is no Hindi imposition,” the Union Minister reiterated.

Earlier, political parties, including the ruling AIADMK, had protested against questions in the postal department’s examination for appointments of postmen and assistants in rural areas held last week being only in Hindi and English, and not Tamil.

After the issue echoed in Parliament, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad assured the Rajya Sabha that the examination would now be held in all local languages, as per the notification of May 10, 2019 of the department concerned with examination, including in Tamil.

To a question on views from certain quarters against the budgetary proposal on Zero Budget Farming vis-a-vis agriculture, Sitharaman said it has already been tried out in some states.

“This is a free country and people can give their opinions. But there are states which have done it at the ground level– Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim and Karnataka– zero budget farming has been helpful to farmers (in these states),” she said.

The proposal was part of the government’s endeavour to double farmers’ incomes, she added.

","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified that the central government is not pushing for Hindi imposition in Tamil Nadu, amidst protests over postal exams being conducted only in Hindi and English. She emphasized the government's commitment to promoting Tamil and denied any deliberate imposition of Hindi, citing the 'EK Bharat Shreshta Bharat' initiative aimed at popularizing Tamil in northern states.

This book including previous volumes is authored by a retired IAS officer and former Advisor to Telangana government, AK Goel, a native of Haryana State, and Telangana his ‘Karma Bhoomi.’ Academic experts, Dr Rekha Pande, Dr Ravulapati Madhavi, and Dr Zareena Parveen co-authored the book.

Dr Zareena Parveen, well-known to research scholars worldwide as a multidimensional professional in the field of History, Archives, Codicology or Manuscriptology and Persian and Urdu Languages, as well as gifted with ‘Brilliant Academic Background,’ shared the book release platform. Other dignitaries were MCR HRD Director General Shashank Goel and chief guest B Vinod Kumar, the State Planning Board Vice Chairman. Dr Zareena Parveen in her address, revealed historical and invaluable information about Chanda Bibi, a brief account of which formed part of Goel’s book, especially about the land owned by her turning as an education edifice, the gigantic Osmania University (OU). Very interesting indeed!!!

Chanda Bibi or Mahalaqa Chanda, born in 1768 and groomed under the patronage of Arastu Jah during Nawab Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah II period, was a great poetess, horse rider, swords woman, archer, master classical dancer, beautiful singer, lady of great honour and repute. God bestowed her with melodious voice and height appropriate for dancing. Contemporary artists never dared compete with her in dance.

She was also a powerful courtier, present minded and sharp-tongued speaker, and spiritual personality. A highly respected philanthropist Mahalaqa earned millions of rupees and spent them lavishly on welfare of her workers, servants, adopted children, sadhus, saints, and religious heads as well as common people and peasants. Mahalaqa Chanda was cool, forthright, serious person exhibiting her well-groomed manners, sense of protocol and aristocratic family back ground, conforming to high stature of every word and every act of her.

Chanda Bibi knew Persian, Arabic, Brij Bhasha besides her mother tongue Urdu. After falling in deep love with Urdu, she sacrificed her life, mind, time, and money on Urdu and with absolute mastery over it, wrote poetry. She spent most of her time in library reading books. Mahalaqa Chanda had already compiled her first collection of poetry and attained fame when legendary Urdu Poet Mirza Ghalib was just a year old. Mahalaqa Chanda’s ‘Divan,’ a compilation of Urdu Ghazals, published posthumously, is a precious treasure of Urdu literature with historical details for future generations. Mahalaqa Chanda’s grandfather and father were noble, decent, and brave persons. Mother was mirror of Gujarati beauty. Grandmother of Mahalaqa Chanda, whose name also was Chanda Bibi, was one in a million beautiful woman. All three daughters of her grandparents, who were from equally illustrious background, namely, Noor Bibi, Polan Bibi, and Maida Bibi were also equally beautiful. And among them, the youngest Maida Bibi was most beautiful. Mahalaqa was born to Bahadur Khan who too belonged to an illustrious family and Maida Bibi or Raj Kunwar Bai, the courtesan who migrated from Rajputana. Mahalaqa Chanda inherited ancestral qualities. History recorded that Mahalaqa Chanda’s maternal side belonged to the illustrious family of Khwaja Gharib Nawaz of Ajmer and her paternal side was rooted in the Sadaat-e-Bahara of Sadat Zaini Dynasty. Mahalaqa Chanda was named at birth as Chanda Bibi. When she was born, the room became full of bright light, a rare phenomenon. Asaf Jah II issued a Farman that Arastu Jah, Diwan, (Prime Minister) of Hyderabad, will take the Khichdi on the elephant for the Celebration of Chatty. It was the first great honour given to Chanda Bibi by Nizam. Mahalaqa Chanda’s life started from the Cabinet of Ministers and ended in the Royal courts. After the demise of Asaf Jah II, whom she used to accompany in his travels, including battlefield, from her 15 years age, Nawab Asaf Jah III was seated and crowned. Nevertheless, Mahalaqa’s privileges continued. She was faithful to Nizam and paid back in kind her obligation as a bread-winner from the Court of Nizam. Her Jagir and estate were spread over Syedpally, Chanderguda, Chandapeth, Ali Bagh, Palle Pahad and several other areas in Hyderabad. Hyderguda, where the renovated old MLA quarters exist now, was owned by Mahalaqa. Adikmet, premises of OU and English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), too, was her estate. A three-storied stepwell on the north west side of EFLU built by Chanda is still in good condition. OU site was a plateau of 1,600 acres 1725 feet above mean sea level. It once formed part of Jagir of Mir Jumla, a noble of the Qutub Shahi period which was later purchased by Mir Hasan and subsequently sold by his inheritors to Mahalaqa. The sprawling campus with enormous chunk of land of OU, constructed in 1930s, stands an ‘Exuberant Testimony’ of ownership of Mahalaqa Chanda. Board of Intermediate Education is also located on land originally owned by her. Before her death in 1824, Chanda Bibi donated her landed properties, granted by Nizam II to those who served her. A century later, in 1928, Mir Osman Ali Khan, acquired land from the Jagir of Mahalaqa Chanda at Adikmet and Tarnaka for Arts College Building of OU. Receipts of compensation paid to Pattadaars in Urdu are available in State Archives. Some sellers received compensation as less as Rs 67. Mahalaqa Chanda’s palace known as ‘Khasa Mahal’ or ‘Khas Haveli’ had walls and roofs painted by great masters of those times, with multicolour photos on different themes, and fixed in the walls decorated with fine and delicate glass work. In the Mushairas conducted by her in the palace, all master poets participated. Uphold of Hyderabadi Culture, Public Manners, Party Behaviour, and Sitting Traditions were greatly depicted during Mushairas. After her death, in 1824, Mahalaqa Chanda was buried next to her mother’s tomb. On a carved teakwood over the door of her mausoleum, inscription in Urdu, that reads in English as 'Alas! Mahalaqa of the Deccan Departed for Heaven’ is seen. AK Goel in his book, in the Chapter on Mahalaqa, concluded that, ‘Posterity would remember her as Haseena-e-Jamal’ meaning ‘Most Beautiful Creation of Almighty on the Planet Forever.’ What a Great Tribute by Goel!!! Dr Zareena Parveen sourced this entire information from Telangana State Archives and Research Institute headed by her. The Institute was originally established as ‘Daftar-I- Diwani- Mal-O-Mulki’ in 1724. Besides India, hundreds of Research Scholars from all over the world, like USA, UK, France, Germany, Australia, Singapore, West Asian countries visit the Institute on a regular basis in pursuit of the glorious and historical past of Telangana as part of their research work. Such a historical institute with three centuries of existence needs rejuvenation for extraordinary care to preserve and protect archived documents from decay over and above, present meticulous care. Maybe it would be a great idea if this Institute is shifted and integrated with Centre for Telangana Studies, housed in MCR HRD Institute, under one roof, with advanced technical support including digitalization of every paper. 75 years ago in 1951, Historian RC Majumdar, with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan support, started editing ‘Indian history, from Vedic Period to Independence’ to publish after 26 years, in Eleven Volumes. With technology in place now, and retrieval of information becoming easier, in a shorter time, AK Goel's multi-volume work on Telangana is no lesser effort than that of Majumdar!!!
","Dr. Zareena Parveen, Director of Telangana State Archives and Research Institute, attended the release of 'Telangana Land and People: From 1724-1858', Volume Three, authored by AK Goel. The book highlights the historical contributions of Chanda Bibi, a prominent figure in Hyderabad's history, known for her poetry and philanthropy. The institute, established in 1724, preserves Telangana's rich heritage and attracts global scholars. The event underscored efforts to digitize archives for broader accessibility. Such initiatives are crucial for preserving cultural legacies and promoting scholarly research.

For India, the political space is a ""giant fortress"" with no room for compromise that ""has made the world safer"". The only other way to move a country on this path is by making it immune to the diseases it is currently facing. This goes with a caveat – and in the case of polio, polio has been curbsivised. And this, I think, ought to make the country's vaccine programme even more effective. It can help. But its effects are far less expected.

I ask Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the chief executive of Pune-based Pune-based vaccine manufacturer, what he would do if this were to happen. He adds: ""You can't take the opportunity to stop polio vaccine development with the use of some'magic dust'. It won't work - this vaccine can only do what you need to do. We need to work with a new immunisation strategy."" There is a sense that even though his vaccination programme has reduced the death toll from polio, the vaccine is still not there. ""I think the vaccination strategy is not enough. We need to expand on existing immunisation programmes"".

As an interim, as with earlier interventions, you can't build an ""alternative medicine"" without addressing its limitations. But it's a very tricky process. And so we must do it now.

To deal with polio and prevent outbreaks such as the one that took place three winters ago, Pune decided to test a vaccine against three human polio species, including one that the Indian government identified as a strain of the disease. As we have always felt in the US and Europe, ""what we are trying to do is look for ways of preventing diseases in their natural habitat.""

Dr. Rajendra Prasad, with Pune vaccine manufacturer

We spent the next six months in a laboratory.

One problem is that these strains are still at risk of infection. What this means is that more testing is needed at which all of these viruses could be identified, and in which a vaccine could be used, which is why the U.S. should continue to test human blood antibodies for them to eradicate Ebola, or polio.

We could say that, although there are a few people affected by these strains, they are already in a very large number of those who might benefit from a vaccine. What we have in place is a new immune response that helps us deal with those infections. That means we can deal with the most prevalent viruses. I'm not surprised that some may consider polio an endemic disease. It is actually very common. But I want to make it a bigger challenge as well.

You cannot do this without introducing new vaccines. We need to make sure that we keep an eye on the numbers of isolates that have been transmitted and, because they are in a very active region of a country, take preventive measures. Our vaccination strategies need to be more intensive and effective. And while we don't say every vaccination is perfect, that's a huge step in the right direction. And there is also a need for more systematic effort to investigate the potential of a vaccine against these infections. To do that we need to start with a more thorough study of the immune systems in humans and in our own communities, which I called ""neuropathological investigation.""

We need to investigate the way that our immune systems interact. Not only with the outside, but also with external organisms as well. We have to consider some forms of food. For example, we can investigate the immune system in the skin. We can investigate the ways that our cells protect themselves from pathogens. What are the characteristics of our cells? We can learn about their makeup, their cell types and even their function. It also helps us know where we are getting those cells.

One of our objectives is to learn about the interplay between these microRNA components that bind together the same RNA as those in body cells. MicroRNAs bind together at the level of their nuclei. Their nucleic acids are different from those of the protein's. And like the proteins, they bind together in ways that are very difficult to differentiate. And we're still trying to understand why this happens.

To understand where we find these microRNAs, we need to understand exactly what these different regulatory factors are, and how they communicate with us. For example, we need to understand the interplay between a certain protein - called the adenine dinucleotide or ADN or an endosomal adenine dinucleotide - and certain other regulatory factors.

And how they coordinate with what's a particular regulatory gene or the DNA, they do a very important job. It's just one-tenth the size of a lot of things. And in the case of this human malaria outbreak","; his speech is more effective than even his own speech For India, the political space is a ""giant fortress"" with no room for compromise that ""has made the world safer"".

Kicking off results for India’s nearly $60 billion IT sector on Friday,Infosys estimated tepid revenue growth due to global economic uncertainty and said margins would decline for the year ending March 2012,highlighting currency risks for the export-focused sector.

Based on what Infosys has reported and forecast,people will taper down their earnings estimates for the top players in the sector,said Tejas Doshi,vice president of research at Sushil Finance in Mumbai.","Infosys Technologies Ltd, India's second-largest software services exporter, triggered concerns about the broader IT sector by forecasting lower-than-expected annual sales. The company attributed this to reduced client spending amid ongoing global economic uncertainties. As a result, Infosys shares fell nearly 10%, reflecting investor anxiety over the sector’s near-term prospects.

Infosys' cautious revenue outlook for the fiscal year ending March 2012 suggests that clients, especially in key markets like the U.S. and Europe, are scaling back on IT budgets. The company also warned of declining profit margins due to currency volatility, which is a significant risk for export-driven firms like Infosys. This has cast a shadow over the entire Indian IT industry, which relies heavily on international demand.

Tejas Doshi, vice president of research at Sushil Finance, noted that Infosys' downbeat forecast would likely lead analysts to lower earnings estimates for other top players in the sector, such as TCS and Wipro. As Infosys typically sets the tone for the industry’s quarterly performance, its weak guidance indicates broader challenges for the \$60 billion Indian IT sector, including pricing pressure, cautious client behavior, and macroeconomic instability. This has raised concerns about sustained growth and profitability across the sector.

While the unlocking has led to some recovery in digital payments, overall digital transactions have declined an average 12% in the last 101 days starting 24 March. The nationwide lockdown was imposed on 25 March.
Financial services products, including payments for insurance and mutual funds, utility bill payments and e-commerce have driven digital payments growth over the last 30 days. Also, several online firms had announced discounts on existing inventory to recover from the loss of business during the lockdown, boosting such transactions.
""The digital payments industry couldn't escape the pandemic crisis, we witnessed a dip of 30% in online payments since the lockdown began, and now seeing a rebound of 23% over the last 30 days is a sign of gradual revival of the digital economy. After witnessing an increased demand for digital payments in Tier 2 & 3 cities, I believe covid-19 has definitely propelled the final push to overthrow cash, which even demonetisation couldn’t,"" said Harshil Mathur, CEO and co-founder, Razorpay.

The Razorpay report added that categories such as utility bill payments and groceries have seen growth double when compared to pre-covid levels.

Payment categories like online education and medical services have also emerged as strong drivers for digital payments during the lockdown.

While the online education sector grew by 23% as extended lockdown led to a massive rise in demand for online courses, payments for medical services increased by 20%, with the rise of online consultations, the report said.

Digital transactions in categories like tour and travel, logistics, lending and food and beverage, however, have seen a severe decline during the last 100 days, as these industries continue to reel from the loss of business due to the pandemic.

According to the report, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Telangana were the major contributors to digital payments during the lockdown.

UPI continued was a clear choice for making payments, commanding a net 45% market share. Card payments and net banking followed next with 37% and 10% marking share respectively.

For e-wallet share of different players on the Razorpay platform, the report said, Flipkart-owned PhonePe was a clear winner for digital payments during the lockdown, garnering 45% market share. Amazon Pay followed a close second, as it continued to offer discounts and offers to lure customers to pay through the platform

The report added that while demand for digital and contactless payments remains high, the value of transactions has declined, which might result in a drop in revenues for the electronics payment market.

In June, total UPI transactions in the country hit an all-time high of 1.34 billion transactions, as per data from National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In April, UPI transactions totalled less than 1 billion.","Digital payment transactions in India have rebounded in the last month as the country began lifting lockdown restrictions imposed due to COVID-19, according to Razorpay. Despite an overall 12% decline in digital transactions over the past 101 days, there has been a 23% increase in the last 30 days. Financial services, utility payments, e-commerce, online education, and medical services have driven this growth. 

Key findings include:
- Significant growth in utility bill payments and groceries.
- Increased digital transactions for online education (23% growth) and medical services (20% growth).
- Declines in sectors like travel, logistics, lending, and food and beverage.
- UPI continues to dominate with a 45% market share, followed by card payments and net banking.
- PhonePe leads in e-wallet transactions with a 45% market share.

The rise in digital payments is attributed to a shift from cash to digital transactions, accelerated by the pandemic."

The officers from various states presented papers highlighting right-wing extremism, politico-religious extremism, left-wing extremism, Islamic radicalisation and internet radicalisation. However, it is the growing Islamic and right-wing radicalisation which drew the officers’ attention.
A senior IPS officer from Manipur – a BJP ruled state – in his paper highlighted that India, though being a plural society, is inching towards majoritarianism. He named the Bajrang Dal and the VHP while writing about right-wing radicalisation.
“Right-wing radical groups have witnessed an upswing in the second decade of the 21st century across continents, and the idea of supremacism has caught the attention of security establishments globally. Far-right individuals or groups tend to aggressively defend national culture and history. They have an authoritative concept of the state, in which the state and the people, all of which are ethnically homogenous, should merge into a single unit,” he wrote.
An IPS officer from Rajasthan in his paper wrote that the demolition of the Babri Masjid, along with the growth of Hindu nationalism, cases of beef lynching, and “ghar vapsi movement,” has been a breeding ground for extremist group to recruit and radicalise young minds.
Further several police officials in their papers mentioned radicalisation, particularly of Muslim youths, as one of the important challenges for national security.
Several radical Muslim organisations are active in India and indulge in organised radicalisation of Muslim youths. They have an inherent tendency to corrupt the minds of the Muslim community, push them on the violent path, and work against composite culture.
Some of the radical Islamic organisations which have been flagged by senior police officials included the Popular Front of India (PFI), the SIMI, the Wahdat-e-Islami, the Islamic Youth Federation, the Hizb-ut Tahreer, and the Al-Ummah. Among these Muslim organisations, the PFI, which is now banned, has been described as the most potent radical organisation.
The danger of Islamic organisations making entry into the Northeast region through the porous boundaries of Assam and Tripura was also strongly highlighted by the officials. Several remedial measures were suggested by the police officials to tackle the growing trend of radicalisation.
The UN has identified radicalisation as the biggest threat to the security and safety of all member states. It has brought the international community together to condemn terrorist acts, and developed the international legal framework to enable states to fight the threat collectively.","Papers presented at the all-India conference of police chiefs highlight growing radicalisation among Hindus and Muslims in India.

The 27-year-old singer turned heads last year when she picked up the gong for Album of the Year for '1989' and gave a moving speech in which she called for young women to ''focus'' on their passions and achieve success.   In a new promotional video released by The Recording Academy, the 'Blank Space' hitmaker's wise words have been recited by young women from all walks of life and career paths, including dancers, musicians, and athletes.   Taylor's powerful speech read: ''I want to say to all the young women out there: There are going to be people along the way who try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.   ''But if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you, someday, when you get where you're going, you will look around and you will know -- it was you, and the people who love you, who put you there. And that will be the greatest feeling in the world.''   The clip - named 'It Was You' - comes as part of the award show's 'Believe In Music' campaign, which The Recording Academy's Chief Marketing Officer Evan Greene said aims to ''tap into what's happening in society''.   He said in a statement: ''Music both reflects and advances culture, so we try to do the same with our annual Grammy Award brand campaigns. I think our campaigns tap into the dominant theme of what's happening in society, and this year, The Recording Academy felt it right to highlight music's uplifting aspects.   ''Although most of the spots carry the message with humour, as a father of two young girls, it was important to me to also create something that would speak specifically to them - and all women - using music's inspirational language to help them feel empowered.''   Since the video's release on Tuesday (31.01.17), the clip has garnered huge support, with Taylor's close friend Gigi Hadid saying it moved her and her sister Bella to ''full tears''.  

","Taylor Swift’s empowering 2016 Grammys speech has been turned into a promotional video for the awards show. In the video, young women from various fields recite Taylor's words about focusing on passion and overcoming obstacles. The clip, part of the ""Believe In Music"" campaign, highlights music's ability to empower, especially women. It has received widespread praise, with Gigi Hadid sharing that it moved her and her sister Bella to tears."
241c74a7347824787eb4bf3e8f900312,"[DOC 1] New Delhi: Often when we break up with someone we are left wondering if we did the right thing or made a huge mistake. Since we all know love is not easy to find, we fixate on this and find ourselves in a limbo of considering the options which are, go back or move on.

While some relationships can be rekindled with time and space, others were never meant to stand the test of time. Take a look at signs that will show you whether it can work, or if it's time to move on.
Signs It Can Work

Communication improvements: Has there been a change in how you communicate your feelings to each other? Often, the cause of why people break up is not being able to truly understand one another and be patient towards how their partner is feeling, to fix the relationship. Do you think that after some time apart you can talk to them more openly and there's a commitment towards doing this more effectively?Reflection: Have you both taken the time to understand where the relationship went wrong and what would be different this time? Taking the time to reflect is very crucial. While you may miss someone, you must know exactly what you want done differently or can do differently this time around. You also have to take into consideration if the two of you have grown individually during your time apart. This will allow the two of you to start fresh and deepen your connection if the two of you have evolved positively.Have the reasons you broke up been resolved? Going back to the same issues will never work. You will just end up where you left off. Knowing exactly what they are and being able to make the required changes so they don't happen again, is the attitude the two of you need, to make this work. It’s a joint effort and having this clarity is the most important thing.Love: Yes, it's a cliche, but we can't ignore it because, as I mentioned, it's the most challenging thing to find. If both of you genuinely love each other and share equal commitment, adopting the attitude of ""whatever comes our way, we'll work through it"" is feasible. However, don't cling to this idea if it isn't working. True love has the power to mend issues and bring harmony. If it lacks harmony, then perhaps this isn't the right love for you.

Signs It Won't Work

Your values and goals don't align: If you and your partner do not share the same view of the future, it will always be an issue because, over time, this will lead to resentment. The destination has to be the same for both of you. If both of you want different things, then your paths can never merge. Also, your core morals, knowing right from wrong, need to align. You need to have a shared view of an inner compass that you both live by. Without this, there will always be conflict.

Lack of effort: As the saying goes, it takes two hands to clap. If one person is putting in all the effort to get the relationship on track again, yet the other isn't, then you need to reevaluate this. Getting a relationship to work once it has a crack is hard work and a joint effort. If one of you is showing disinterest or not investing time, then this implies that the effort is completely one-sided.

Repeated Issues: If the same issues keep popping up, then this will never work. For relationships to work, past baggage has to be left in the past. If even after trying to resolve them they still keep popping up, then that means they are still very much in the present. And, after everything, if it's still there, then you have to consider that perhaps it'll never be resolved.

Lack of emotional or physical intimacy: If there is a disconnect between these two things and you don't know why, it's because there is a possibly much deeper underlying issue. Without these two things, a relationship can never flourish, and it can never grow. It will also feel like something is missing.

Figuring out whether to go back to a relationship or move on can leave you in a place of limbo. However, getting your answers is the best thing you can do for yourself. Don’t be afraid to figure it out and take the call. Whatever happens, you are going to end up exactly where you need to be. A wise person once said to me, ""Treat your love life like a book. For you to know how the story ends, you need to be brave enough to turn the page.""","Navigating post-breakup uncertainty can be daunting. Signs it might work include improved communication, resolved past issues, shared reflection, and genuine love. Signs it might not work include misaligned values, lack of joint effort, recurring issues, and a gap in intimacy. Ultimately, clarity empowers you to turn the page, leading you to where you're meant to be."

0da1d70bc1d9bf5d6a5e7c3e459e21c1,"[DOC 1] Individuals lacking a solid grasp of personal finance can turn to the widely acclaimed publication “The Simple Path to Wealth: Your Guide to Financial Independence and a Fulfilling, Unrestricted Life"" authored by JL Collins. Collins, an author and speaker in the realm of personal finance, imparts his wisdom on investing, money management, and life. In addition to maintaining a blog, he has authored ""The Simple Path to Wealth,"" a book aimed at guiding contemporary investors in effectively managing their personal finances.The book promotes a clear-cut strategy for investment, emphasizing the use of low-cost index funds and the power of long-term compounding. It underscores the importance of maintaining a lifestyle below one’s financial means, automating investment processes, and steering clear of unnecessary fees.Moreover, this book encapsulates a more encompassing philosophy of financial planning. It advocates for streamlining your financial approach, concentrating on essential principles, and steering clear of intricate or high-risk strategies. The objective is to steadily and consistently accumulate wealth over time, eschewing the pursuit of quick-rich schemes. Several fundamental principles frequently linked to this book, essentially serving as a guide to understanding how to navigate personal finance decisions, encompass:

Living within your financial limits
The foundation for wealth-building lies in living beneath your means. It involves a deliberate decision to expend less than what you earn, channelling the excess towards savings and investments. While it may appear straightforward, this is a potent principle with the potential to significantly influence your financial future.

The concept of spending less than you earn entails monitoring your expenditures, developing a budget, and pinpointing areas where you can economize. It’s important to note that it’s not about deprivation; instead, it’s about making intelligent choices that align with your long-term objectives.

Putting money into low-cost index funds
Putting your money into low-cost index funds provides an excellent means to construct a diversified portfolio and attain robust long-term returns. To begin with, index funds offer extensive market exposure by tracking specific market indices such as the S&P 500 or a total stock market index. This implies immediate ownership of a diverse basket containing hundreds or even thousands of stocks, effectively spreading risk across various companies, sectors, and industries.

Furthermore, the diversification resulting from investments in index funds helps mitigate market fluctuations. With no single company or sector exerting a significant impact on your investment portfolio, this approach provides stability in contrast to concentrated holdings.

Additionally, index funds passively follow indexes, minimizing management expenses. With expense ratios much lower than those of actively managed funds, they incur significantly fewer charges, allowing you to retain a greater portion of your investment returns. Reduced fees enable your returns to compound over time, exerting a significant influence on your long-term wealth. Even a slight disparity in fees can accumulate into a substantial sum in the future.

Adopting a long-term perspective 
Adopting a long-term perspective forms the foundation of successful index fund investing. Consider an 8% annual return on investments over the next 10 years. While that results in a substantial gain, the real power of compounding becomes evident over 30 years, when your money more than quadruples. The compounding effect, where your returns earn returns, creates a snowball effect, accelerating the creation of wealth.

The greater the duration of your investment, the more compounding has the opportunity to work its magic. Early contributions and consistent investments, even in modest amounts, can have a substantial impact on your future nest egg. Over time, short-term market fluctuations become less relevant. While individual years may experience gains or losses, adopting a long-term perspective helps smooth out these fluctuations, enabling compounding to fulfill its potential.

Shifting your focus to decades rather than days reduces anxiety related to market fluctuations. By placing trust in the long-term trend, you steer clear of the temptation to engage in panic selling or make impulsive decisions.

Set your investments on auto mode
Implementing financial automation is akin to putting your wealth-building on cruise control, seamlessly steering you toward a more prosperous future. It serves as a clandestine tool for numerous accomplished investors. Automating your finances involves regularly transferring predetermined amounts from your checking account to your specified goals, day in and day out. Once set, you can leave it to operate in the background, and yet, your wealth continues to flourish.

Firstly, it alleviates the challenge of saving when confronted with enticing expenses. Automation eliminates the temptation, guaranteeing that your financial priorities are addressed before you even consider spending. It’s a case of “out of sight, out of mind"", all the while steadily enhancing your financial security.

The appeal of automation resides in its unwavering consistency. Consistent deposits harness the power of compounding, where your returns generate additional returns over time. It’s akin to a snowball effect, progressively expanding your wealth exponentially.

Don’t incur debt
Steering clear of debt, or at the very least reducing it, is a fundamental aspect of a sound financial life. Debt binds you with ongoing interest payments, depleting your income and constraining your available resources. By minimizing debt, you liberate these resources for essential needs, savings, or investments.

Reduced debt means having more liquid funds for daily expenditures, emergencies, or unforeseen opportunities. This provides financial flexibility, eliminating the stress of managing numerous debt payments. Maintaining low levels of debt contributes to a positive credit score, paving the way for improved loan terms, lower interest rates, and even favourable insurance premiums. A robust credit score becomes a valuable asset for upcoming financial endeavours.

Investing principles don’t have to be tedious and intricate. While it’s true that elaborate money-making strategies can come with a high cost, and though some have proven beneficial in the long run, JL Collins offers a perspective on personal finance that is accessible and straightforward. His skill in making dull financial concepts amusing and engaging highlights how savings and investments can be straightforward for those ready to take control of their finances.","""The Simple Path to Wealth"" by JL Collins is a widely acclaimed guide to personal finance, offering straightforward and accessible advice on investing, money management, and life. The book advocates for a clear-cut investment strategy, emphasizing low-cost index funds and the power of long-term compounding. Key principles include living within one's financial limits, spending less than earning, and making intelligent choices aligned with long-term objectives. The importance of putting money into low-cost index funds is highlighted for constructing a diversified portfolio with robust long-term returns. Adopting a long-term perspective is emphasized, showcasing the power of compounding over time. Automation of finances, setting investments on autopilot, is recommended to ensure consistency and harness the benefits of compounding.

8ff6406cfcd99f934132e361b2a29b55,"[DOC 1] LUCKNOW: After former director-general of police Prakash Singh, it is now the turn of the UP Provincial Services Association (UPPSA) to test the government's commitment, if any, to uphold the citizen's right to information as provided under the Right to Information Act, 2005.
The association has fired five queries seeking details regarding promotion of officers from other state services to IAS cadre and postings of PCS officers.

If the state government answers honestly, the questions would expose alleged anomalies in the out-of-turn promotions of 'favourite' officers.
Submitted through proper channel, Hardev Singh, president UPPSA, has asked Mohan Singh Chauhan, principal secretary and state public information officer, appointment department, to reply and furnish details as per Right to Information Act.


In the first question, Singh has asked the government why only one PCS officer ��� RK Singh��� was promoted to IAS cadre in 2001 and the remaining seven posts earmarked to be filled through PCS officers were left vacant.
Further, was there any proposal under government's consideration to promote officers from other state services to the seven posts?

The second question hits state government's reported move to promote seven 'favourite' officers from other state services.

Giving reference of rules that officers having outstanding merit and ability from other state services can be promoted to IAS cadre under special circumstances, that too after serving eight continuous years on a post equivalent to deputy collector, Singh has asked the government to specify its criterion to judge ""outstanding merit"" and what are the ""posts in other state services declared equivalent to deputy collector.
He has asked for all notifications and orders issued in this regard.
The third question is even more direct. It has asked government to provide copies of directions issued by two former chief ministers in which they had ordered that ""other services quota"" in IAS cadre would be filled by promoting only PCS officers.


The decision was taken, keeping in view the stagnation in PCS cadre. Through the fourth question, it has asked for details of an order by a former chief minister who had directed that other state services officers considered for promotion into IAS cadre should not be junior to those PCS officers who could not get an opportunity of promotion.


The last question gives reference of government orders dated October 12, 2001, and January 13, 2003, which have categorised posts in the administration on the basis of their importance, with instructions that PCS officers will be deputed on these posts on the basis of seniority.

Singh has asked the information officer whether or not these orders are being followed and if not then the list of officers posted in violation of these orders should be provided.","The UP Provincial Services Association (UPPSA) has submitted five queries under the Right to Information Act, 2005, regarding the promotion of officers from other state services to the IAS cadre and the postings of PCS officers. These queries aim to uncover alleged anomalies in the promotion process and bring transparency to government actions. The questions address issues such as the criteria for promotion, vacancies in the IAS cadre, and adherence to government orders regarding postings. The association seeks details on promotions, notifications, orders, and directions issued by former chief ministers related to the promotion process.

The incident took place on the outskirts of Rajkot on Saturday. Although no FIR has been filed in the matter, police said they are looking for the man who allegedly wrote the abusive words.

They further termed the accusation against the foreigner an attempt “to frame the students and raise an issue against them”. According to police, Jefferson, who has been identified by only one name, was on his way back from the market along with his two sisters when his bike almost ran into the car being driven by one Ravi in Gauridad village. Ravi got out of his car and engaged in a spat with the student of Marwadi University before hitting him with a stick on the chest, according to a statement from Kuvadva road police station on Sunday. Ravi then fled from the spot, leaving his car behind.

Meanwhile, on getting to know about the incident, a few students from Jefferson’s university arrived at the spot.

Around this time, 25 residents of the village also gathered near the abandoned car. The villagers alleged that the foreign students had carved swear words against Indians on the dust on the car’s windshield. However, the students denied the allegation, stating they had video footage of the entire incident from the moment Ravi fled the spot.

“The video shows a local man writing the swear words abusing Indians. The police are attempting to nab this person,” said the statement from the police.The police said the issue stemmed from a three-year-old dispute between the people of Gauridad village and some foreign students after which the entire village had resolved not to give homes to African students on rent.

Based on Saturday’s incident, an application was filed at Kuvadva police station by the African students of the university and further investigation is underway. Naresh Jadeja, registrar of Marwadi University, told The Indian Express, “The incident that happened on Saturday night following a road accident was reported to the police by the students. Nobody was injured or harmed but it involved a verbal dispute. Since students were not at fault, we are with them. The police called both the parties and resolved the issue.” Inspector BP Rajya of Kuvadva Road police station said, “We have not converted the application into an FIR because the students decided against it in the larger interest of peace. However, we have recorded their statements as well as that of the car owner (who was later tracked down). We are still looking to apprehend the person who wrote the abuses on the car.”","A near-accident in Rajkot escalated into a physical altercation and accusations between a foreign student from Liberia and a local resident. The incident occurred on Saturday when Jefferson, a student at Marwadi University, almost collided with a car driven by Ravi in Gauridad village. After the near-miss, Ravi reportedly attacked Jefferson with a stick before fleeing the scene. Shortly afterward, a group of villagers accused the foreign students of writing offensive swear words on the car's windshield. However, the students denied the accusation, claiming to have video footage showing a local man writing the offensive words. The police are investigating the matter and attempting to apprehend the individual responsible for the graffiti. Although no FIR has been filed, the police recorded statements from both parties, and the issue is being resolved peacefully. The dispute is believed to be linked to a prior three-year-old conflict between Gauridad villagers and foreign students."

The Congress, which will bring innovators and scientists under one roof, will be held on the premises of Lovely Professional University (LPU).

The University will showcase its own innovation in the form of a solar-powered driverless bus. The eco-friendly heavy vehicle will ferry passengers to the aerodrome, housing societies, industrial complexes, and educational institutions.

University spokesperson said that the design of the solar bus has been made in accordance with the available Indian infrastructure. The bus, which will cost Rs six lakh each, can have seating capacity between 10 and 30 and can run at the maximum speed of 30 km per hour.

“We are very happy to design a completely driverless and eco-friendly bus to welcome PM Modi. If his schedule and security arrangements permit, we would love to give him a tour of our campus in the bus,” said the project head Mandeep Singh.

Chancellor Ashok Mittal said that the driverless bus is an example of LPU students being at the forefront of technology.

440789e41275e82f3f1d05313a05591f,"[DOC 1] Tarsem Singh’s indulgent epic, produced by Spike Jonze and David Fincher, was little seen on its original release in 2006, and now gets a rerelease in a 4K restoration on the Mubi streaming platform. It’s certainly worth noticing, with its Gilliamesque surrealism, and its setting in Rajasthan, north-western India, offers wonderful landscapes. Its beguiling set pieces feature Justine Waddell playing some deadpan comedy as a gloriously costumed princess – although I have to admit that in general the film’s rather placid, stately, fantasy style can be exasperatingly inert.

The scene is Los Angeles in the early years of silent pictures; Lee Pace plays Roy, a stuntman who is now seriously, perhaps permanently, injured. He is laid up in hospital and deeply depressed after a dangerous fall filming a movie whose lead actress was once his girlfriend, but has now left him for the vapid male star. Roy is befriended by a little Romanian girl from the neighbouring children’s ward; this is Alexandria (played by Catinca Untaru, whose English dialogue is sometimes a little indistinct). Kindly, Roy offers to tell the wide-eyed Alexandria an epic story of adventure featuring five heroes battling a hateful governor, and the story comes to life before our eyes with Roy and Alexandria appearing in it and some whimsical muddling up of Indians and Native Americans.
But Roy has an ulterior motive with this Scheherazade-type storytelling; he wants to take Alexandria into his confidence so that she will steal a bottle of morphine for him, perhaps so that he can take his own life. Waddell plays a nurse who appears to be having an affair with a doctor, and she appears in the story as the princess who is engaged to be married to the warriors’ enemy, but falls for Roy. There are some startling images and the film has a distinct, odd flavour of its own.","Tarsem Singh’s The Fall (2006) is an ambitious, visually stunning epic that blends surreal fantasy with poignant human drama. Set in 1920s Los Angeles, it tells the story of Roy (Lee Pace), a stuntman who is bedridden and depressed after a debilitating injury. He befriends Alexandria, a young girl in the hospital, and begins to tell her a fantastical tale about five heroes on a quest to defeat an evil governor. The story unfolds as a vivid, dreamlike fantasy, with breathtaking set pieces and stunning landscapes, notably in Rajasthan, India.

While the film is visually captivating, with Gilliam-esque surrealism and lush costuming, its slow, dreamlike pacing can feel inert at times. The film also explores darker themes, as Roy's storytelling serves an ulterior motive—he is trying to manipulate Alexandria into stealing morphine for him, possibly to end his life. The film blends fantasy and reality, with characters from the hospital appearing in the story Roy narrates. Justine Waddell plays both a hospital nurse and a princess in Roy’s tale, adding layers to the narrative.

The Fall is a unique, visually rich film with a distinct style and emotional depth, though its languid pace and introspective tone may not resonate with everyone."

It plans to induct 2,000 new buses, including 500 e-buses, and to also introduce VTMS (Vehicle Tracking & Monitoring System), a mobile app, and cashless travel this year. Anbu Kumar, Managing Director, KSRTC, said that the KSRTC will add 20 Ambari Utsav, 20 Airavat Club Class, 100 Pallaki buses which fall in the non-AC sleeper category, 1000 point to point Karnataka Sarige buses and 500 electric buses. Apart from this Mr. Kumar added that 1000 refurbished buses will be added to the fleet in 2024. Following the launch of Shakti that provides free travel to women in State-owned non-premium transport corporation buses, there’s been a significant demand for KSRTC buses, particularly in rural areas. A senior official said that the plan to induct 1000 Karnataka Sarige buses will improve rural connectivity in the State and it will also help the beneficiaries of the scheme. After the Karnataka government launched the Shakti scheme, the four corporations (KSRTC, the BMTC, the NWKRTC, and the KKRTC) planned to procure 3,888 new buses. Currently, the four RTCs operate 23,989 buses across the State with an average run of 65.02 lakh kilometres per day.Meanwhile, it is not clear as to how many buses will be taken off roads this year in light of the recent High Court order, which said KSRTC should obtain fitness certificate for its buses from the Regional Transport Officers (RTOs) every year.

Speaking to reporters here, Kishan Reddy wondered if there is any ""tacit"" understanding between the Congress government in the state and the BRS party on the issue, through meditation of AIMIM.

""When in Opposition, the Congress leaders demanded a CBI inquiry into the issue. Today, why is the chief minister (Revanth Reddy) not writing a letter to the Centre seeking a CBI probe? Does the Congress government sincerely want an inquiry into the Kaleshwaram project or not? Do they want the culprits to be punished or not?"" Kishan Reddy asked.

""I want to know whether the chief minister has any sincerity. The biggest scam of the BRS government was the Kaleshwaram project. Are you willing to order a CBI inquiry? Would you write a letter (to CBI),"" the Telangana BJP chief asked.

During the assembly polls (last year), the Congress claimed that if voted to power, it would order an inquiry on ""corruption"" deeds including projects undertaken by the then BRS government, he said.

The previous government claimed the Kaleshwaram project as an engineering marvel and the largest lift irrigation project. They also said that concrete used in the project was equivalent to that of seven 'Burj Khalifa' in Dubai and steel was equivalent to that of 15 'Eiffel Tower' in Paris, he said.

The piers of the Medigadda barrage of the mega Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme 'sinking' shook the state in October 2023 as it snowballed into a major controversy and a key election issue. The National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) had found that the barrage was severely compromised, rendering it useless unless fully rehabilitated.

Kishan Reddy asked what is the future of Kaleshwaram project and the Telangana people and what is the fate of ₹1 lakh crore spent on the project.

The Medigadda barrage was a lifeline to the Kaleshwaram project, he said, adding that the NDSA also visited it and highlighted some of the key issues of the project. They sought some more details from the state government. However, replies were given to only 11 of the 20 issues, the BJP leader said.

""Why is the Congress government dilly-dallying on the corruption involved in the construction of the project? Will they accept NDSA suggestions? When they (Congress) were in opposition, Revanth Reddy wanted to know what the Central government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were doing. Now there is a necessity to spell out the state government’s stand on the issue,"" he said.

Earlier, when the BJP demanded an inquiry, the then Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao did not approve the CBI probe, Kishan Reddy said.","Hyderabad, Jan 2 (PTI) Union Minister and Telangana BJP president G Kishan Reddy on Tuesday sought to know why Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy hadn’t written a letter to the Centre seeking a CBI inquiry on alleged corruption in the Kaleshwaram project in the state.

Speaking on a wide range of issues, the Opposition leader said if Congress comes to power, they would ensure Rs 6,000 for old age pension. Currently, the Haryana government disburses Rs 5,538 to 17 lakh beneficiaries.
“We will provide gas cylinders at Rs 500 against the current Rs 1,100,” he said. When the Congress government is formed in the state, 300 units of free electricity will be given, Hooda said as a poll pitch ahead of the 2024 Haryana Legislative Assembly election scheduled to be held on or before October to elect all MLAs.
On the treatment meted out to wrestlers, Hooda said, “We saw what our daughters had to face at Jantar Mantar and if we come to power, we will ensure the appointment of sportspersons to senior posts like DSP.” For OBCs, the creamy layer limit will be increased from Rs 6 to Rs 10 lakh, he promised.
On the three-day strike launched by truck, bus and tanker drivers to protest against the stringent jail and fine regulations under the newly-launched Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) for hit-and-run cases, Hooda said, “New law was made without consultation with drivers and will be rectified when the Congress government is formed,” Hooda said.
A group of protesters met the former chief minister to air their grievances and submitted a representation on Tuesday.
Mahendragarh MLA Rao Dan Singh said, “Mewat is an area where at least one member of the household is a driver and this comes as a blow to them.” He added that Haryana is disappointed with theBJP-JJP government and will soon vote for Hooda.
“Till 2014, Haryana was number one in per capita income, per capita investment, job creation, law and order, welfare of farmers, poor and businessmen,” Hooda said, adding that the BJP-JJP government gave nothing to Haryana, except unemployment, misery and destruction.
Captain Ajay Yadav, who contested Lok Sabha elections from the Gurgaon constituency consisting of Nuh, said Mewat only knows the language of brotherhood while BJP speaks the language of hatred.
Addressing the Congress workers meeting organised by the party’s deputy leader in the Assembly Aftab Ahmed, MLAs Mohammad Ilyas, and Maman Khan, Hooda said Haryana has rejected the politics of division practised by the BJP.
Speaking toThe Indian Expresson the cow protection law in the state, Hooda said it is the law even though it has been called arbitrary and unconstitutional for the powers it gives private entities apart from the police.
In his address, Hooda said BJP-JJP do politics of division only in the name of religion, while brotherhood and development form the basis of Congress’s politics.
“The present government is trying to destroy the medical college built in Mewat during the Congress government. The hospital has neither doctors nor medicines. Centuries of brotherhood, which was not broken even during the partition of 1947, was tested under the present government,” he said.

Police said they have zeroed in on a supplier in Nepal who would be nabbed soon.

The main accused in the case, Naveen Arya, remains absconding. Arya, who runs a shop at Bhagirath Palace in Chandni Chowk, claiming to sell drugs to treat cancer and hepatitis, was arrested by another unit of the Crime Branch last year in a similar case. He remained in prison for 4-5 months before being granted regular bail. It didn’t take long for him to engage in the same business and operate a network, this time from another route, said police.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Crime Vikram Singh said that as per the report of the drug inspector, the medicines are fake. “We have also sent the seized drugs to the forensics laboratory for examination. A detailed report is awaited,” said the DCP.

A team led by DCP Singh and comprising Assistant CP Yashpal, Inspector Ashish Sharma, Sub-Inspectors (SIs) Prakash and Guman, and Assistant SI Sandeep Chawla, among others, has been working on the case.

Officers said that the role of Arya’s wife is also under scrutiny, adding that her mobile phone was being used to take online orders.

Police said the fact that the syndicate dealt only in cash is making it difficult to establish the money trail. “There are no bills as well; Arya took orders online and spoke to people on WhatsApp, leaving no trace. We request people to come forward, in case they have purchased drugs like these online, so that we can unearth the chain. We are also looking at cases registered in different states to see if there are any links or possible similarities,” said Singh.

Notably, Arya had earlier applied for anticipatory bail in a city court, which was rejected. The next date of hearing is in July.

In the first week of June, Delhi Police claimed to have busted a “well-organised racket that sold spurious, unauthorised, and unregistered cancer drugs” to patients. Six people were arrested in three simultaneous raids — at Laxmi Nagar, Budh Vihar, and Chandni Chowk — and counterfeit medication worth several lakhs was seized, police said.

Police said the accused targeted cancer patients through social media groups, claiming to offer expensive drugs at discounted rates.

Later, two more persons, who were allegedly supplying the counterfeit cancer vials to people in Delhi-NCR, were also arrested. It was during the questioning of these two accused that the police learnt about the drugs coming through the Kathmandu route, said officers.","Delhi Police’s investigation into a spurious cancer drugs racket busted earlier this month has revealed that fake medicines were being routed into India via Kathmandu, Nepal, according to officials. A supplier in Nepal has been identified and is likely to be arrested soon.

The main accused, Naveen Arya, who previously ran a cancer drug shop in Chandni Chowk’s Bhagirath Palace, remains absconding. He was earlier jailed in a similar case and resumed operations post-bail using a new network and route. His wife’s involvement is also being probed, as her mobile was used to process online orders.

The racket functioned entirely on cash, with no billing or paper trail, making financial tracking difficult. Arya used WhatsApp to take orders, further complicating evidence collection. Authorities are urging potential victims to come forward to help trace the distribution chain.

Six arrests have been made so far, with counterfeit cancer drugs worth lakhs seized in raids at Laxmi Nagar, Budh Vihar, and Chandni Chowk. Further arrests revealed that the Kathmandu route was used for smuggling.

Forensic tests on the seized drugs are underway, and the next court hearing on Arya’s rejected bail plea is scheduled for July.

ebbd288115ef4eec9a73be0a4624a3cf,"[DOC 1] Terror, whatever the source, is a threat to India. Let’s not use it for political one-upmanship.
Negative politics has derailed what should have been a meaningful debate into the challenge emerging from recently unearthed terror groups who seem to have been behind the Mecca masjid blast in Hyderabad in 2007, the outrage at Ajmer Sharif dargah, Malegaon in 2008 and last year in Goa. By seeking to dub these outfits as saffron, the Congress, notably All India Congress Committe general secretary Digvijaya Singh, has pitted these subversive elements against so-called Islamic fundamentalists. By dragging in an emotive issue like the call from the late Hemant Karkare who allegedly expressed fears that he was the target of ‘saffron’ terrorists, Mr Singh has further vitiated the atmosphere.

It is possible that Karkare was apprehensive of threats to his life, but one must question Mr Singh’s motive for making this public at a time when investigations are on into the activities of people like Swami Assemanand and his cohorts who seem to have links with several terror attacks. It is condemnable that few seem inclined to denounce terror for what it is instead of politicising it. The BJP appears to be soft-pedalling the issue, perhaps worried about reactions from its parent body the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh which has torn a strip off Mr Singh on the Karkare issue. Terror, whatever the source, has become a grave threat to India’s peace and stability. The home minister has rightly been putting into place several agencies that will tackle this menace in a more comprehensive and coordinated manner. All political parties need to work together on this issue.

Terrorists do not owe their loyalties to any legitimate political formation, a lesson we should have learnt from the incidents in neighbouring Pakistan. To say that some terrorists may be acting in the name of Hindutva cannot be condemned as anti-national. Terrorists have demonstrated that they can strike at will and are able to take advantage of political dissonance of the sort we are witnessing now. Such irresponsible talk can only fuel a fear psychosis and whip up negative public sentiments. A carnage of the magnitude of 26/11 should have galvanised people across the political spectrum to treat terror as the most difficult challenge India faces. Today we have vibrant intelligence-sharing arrangements with several countries, most notably the US. But, we cannot expect people to believe we are serious about the fight against terror if it is reduced to political one-upmanship. Terror has many faces but certainly not different colours.","The article emphasizes the need for a united front against terrorism in India, irrespective of its origin, rather than using it for political gains. The author criticizes the Congress party, particularly All India Congress Committee general secretary Digvijaya Singh, for labeling certain terror groups as ""saffron"" and bringing in emotive issues, such as the late Hemant Karkare's alleged concerns about being a target of ""saffron"" terrorists. The article calls for denouncing terrorism as a grave threat to India's peace and stability, urging all political parties to work together to address this menace. It emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to counterterrorism."
6fdaa3ce3f10515725035cb159c4d613,"[DOC 1] In an interview with ET Now, Mark Mobius, Chairman, Templeton EM Group, talks about QE2, emerging and frontier markets as well as sectors they are still excited about. Excerpts:

Over the last two weeks, since the QE2 announcement, there is talk of a whole lot of money going to be infused into the US financial system. There is one argument that the large part of that money is going to flow into emerging markets. Would you believe that is a little exaggerated or is that really going to be the case?

Mark Mobius: Would not say the majority is going to flow into the emerging markets, but a significant amount is flowing into not only emerging markets but ETFs and into commodities, and into all kinds of instruments that will pay or promise to pay a higher rate of return than what people are getting on US treasuries.

Given what you just said, should markets like India start beginning to worry about potential bubbles being created in various asset classes?

Mark Mobius: Yes, I think that is certainly a possibility. We do not see it yet, but we have to be very cautious. The good news is that this money, that has been ploughing into not only our funds but other emerging market funds and into the markets, has been largely absorbed by new IPOs and secondary issues. Last year we calculated about 260 billion in IPOs and secondary issues. This year, it will be double that amount to over 450 billion. So this money is coming in and is being absorbed to a great extent. But if it continues, then valuations may rise to unreasonable levels.

There is an argument that QE2 is only going to drive up valuations in emerging markets, you do not need to yet start worrying about asset bubbles being created. Those same people actually believe that by the middle of next year the US economy is still going to be in pretty bad shape, the Fed is going to hold back on raising rates and they might actually push ahead with QE3. Do you see that likelihood?

That is a possibility. But the criticism that has been received regarding QE2 and also the lessons that have been learnt, has resulted what has happened in the last two years. The administration is going to change course and take measures that more directly impact job creation and you all know what that is. It is helping small and medium size business, cutting down on government intervention, etc. there are lot of measures they can take without throwing money from helicopter, so to speak.
QE2 has also meant that yields on US treasuries will decline. We are already seeing that happen. Do you expect that US fixed income investors on account of lower yields will actually start beginning to redeploy resources and possibly redeploy some of that money into equities?

Mark Mobius: Yes, but more importantly, they will deploy them into emerging market bonds as well because some investors are dedicated bond investors and they cannot go into equities by definition of their mandate. So they will go into emerging market bonds because they found that first of all emerging market bonds pay a higher rate and secondly, they can make money on the currency.

This is a very interesting, unusual and different scenario that we had in past years where anybody from the US or Europe looking at emerging market bonds would only buy Euro or US dollar denominated bonds. Now they are buying local currency bonds which by the way is very good for emerging markets because it means they have an opportunity to develop their bond market. So you are going to see more of that and of course equities will get their share.

You have got countries in emerging regions coming out and trying to check the rise of their currencies which the US has issues with. Should the US be objecting to that when it believes that pumping up its economy through QE is the best way forward? None of the emerging economies are complaining about the US going ahead with QE2. Why should the US complain about them checking their currency rises?

You are right, the shoe should fit on both feet because emerging markets naturally are concerned about the appreciation of their currencies. The only way they can avoid appreciation is by buying US dollars, US treasury bonds. So they end up with these piles of US treasury bonds which is a risk in itself by the way because the valuations of those bonds may not hold up.

But there is no reason why the US should be complaining about these countries trying to prevent a rapid increase in the value of their currencies. In some cases of course many of these emerging market currencies are still undervalued. Yes, countries like Brazil since the beginning of the year have seen a 20-30% appreciation of their currency against US dollar. But if you go down a list of these countries, you see many of them are undervalued on price parity basis.

Even if China and other emerging markets actually do allow their currencies to appreciate and to go up, is it actually going to address the global imbalances that the US and the other OECD markets keep talking about? The big advantage that emerging economies have is not their currencies, it is their much cheaper labour markets.

An appreciation of the Yuan/renminbi in China and other currencies could exacerbate the problems in the US because the products that are being made in these countries - particularly in China and India – and services provided by Indian firms are keeping inflation in America and Europe down. You walk into a Wal-Mart or any retail outlet in America or Europe, you see it is full of goods from emerging markets - particularly from China.
So a rapid appreciation of the Chinese currency will mean that retail prices in these countries will go up. That is not good because it means inflation will go up and they will not be able to carry out the programmes that they are trying to achieve. So we have to be very careful in allowing these currencies to appreciate too rapidly. A gradual appreciation is good as this allows people to adjust, but a rapid appreciation could present real problems.

There are some people who actually believe that the current large capital flows into Asia are going to lead to the creation of asset bubbles and that Asia could be headed towards in 1997 like situation. Is that something you would go with?

Of course, as I really do feel that bubbles will come. It is a nature of these markets because people do get carried away. The mere fact that you are asking this question now means that people are thinking about that and they are very aware of the danger. Therefore, probably, they will now not allow it to happen. But given the few years and the continued bullishness in these markets, you could see a sort of mania beginning again - like we saw with the subprime and with the dotcom bubble. The problem nowadays is that the volatility increases much - much greater because the amount of money out there is much greater and the derivative market is much bigger and that creates volatility.

While things do not look so worrisome at this point, in time surely there are pockets in Asia that are beginning to overheat. Which regions and asset classes would you be worried about at this point of time?

It is very difficult to see any particular region or asset class that is overheated at this stage of the game. It is true some smaller markets have moved up dramatically, but you must remember that the valuations have not gone down because the earnings per share of companies have gone up a lot. So if you look at around the price earnings or price to book or dividend yield, I cannot think of any market that is really overheated to the extent that I would run in the other direction immediately.
Talking about India, would you worry about valuations given the current levels that the markets are at?

No, I do not think so. There are still lots of opportunities here. If you look at historical numbers, historical price earnings ratios look expensive. But if you look forward what these companies are going to do next year, the year after, the growth rates are very high in many of these countries and the structure of this society is going to mean the take off stage for many levels of the society is near at hand.
In India, which sectors are you still excited about and which sectors would you be a little worried about?

One of the sectors we are particularly excited about is consumer sector - anything to do with consumers. We love the consumers because there are more of them in Asia, begin in China, begin here in India and their per captia income is moving up at a fast pace because we have seen a deceleration of population growth and an acceleration of economic growth. So if you are growing at 7-8% in real terms and your population is growing, let’s say, 1%, then obviously per capita income is moving up. So that is one scenario and one area that we really like.

The other is commodities. We believe that commodity prices will continue to trend upwards, whether it is palladium, whether it is platinum, whether it is coal, whether it is oil, nickel - you name it. We think these prices will trend upwards. So we want to be exposed to that sector. In terms of sectors that we would not want to be in, given the appreciation of currencies or the imminent appreciation of currencies, export-oriented companies are something that we have to be careful about. I am not saying that all of them should not be bought, but we have to look at those carefully.

You did talk about being bullish on commodities and consumers, how about the infrastructure space, how about banking? Do you believe those sectors have been a little overbought and that at the moment you do not see value there?

Banking, we are in and we like because of consumer banking. When I state consumers, it covers a pretty wide spectrum and consumer banks are very interesting because in many of these countries, many people do not even have bank accounts. So there is a long way to go in that regard. Talking about infrastructure, we have to pick on a sector by sector, country by country basis because any of these infrastructure plays are regulated normally and unless you have got an iron-clad contract which defines how the investors are going to get paid, you can get into real trouble. So that is something you have to watch.

When you take a bird’s eye view of the opportunity that the consumer space offers for banking, it does look extremely lucrative. But we have seen banks in India take extremely long time in actually breaking even on their consumer operations. Is that something that worries you because we have had some banks that have been in the business for more than 10 years and they still continue to lose money in that space?

Yes, there has been real problem with some of these banks. Part of that is regulation. In other words, limits on interest rates means that they have to be very careful who they are lending to. If they have high risk and they cannot high risk consumers and borrowers and cannot raise the rates to cover the non-performing loans, then you have a problem. I think a lot of this has been related to inefficiencies within the banks. Many of the banks have not carted on how to make their operations more efficient. But it is coming and we have seen in many instances that banks in India are really beginning to change the way they operate and become more efficient.
Do you believe the manufacturing sector looks a little worrisome right now simply because of the huge pick up or huge rise that they are going to see in input costs?

Exactly, that is something we have to be very careful and that is the reason why I did not mention manufacturing. It is a sector which we would want to necessarily be very heavy on - depending on individual company and the individual opportunity. But given the cost, a lot of these companies are getting squeezed. On the one hand, they have lots of competition. So their selling prices cannot be raised. On the other side, the inputs - the commodities that they use - are rising in price. So it presents a real opportunity for the commodity producers, but not one for the people that are consuming.

A number of overseas investors into India talk about their concerns about governance practices with Indian companies. Are you happy with the progress that you have seen with governance practices at Indian companies, especially the promoter or rather family-run companies?

Generally speaking, India is quite good. One of the reasons for this is that the Indian companies are articulate. The command that Indian managers have of language - of English language in particular and language in general - and their ability to express themselves really well augurs well for communicating their systems in the way they operate and this is good for corporate governance. So this is a good exchange of information between the stakeholders and share holders and the company.

So generally speaking, India is no worse than other countries including the US. Corporate governance in the US has not been too good. But generally speaking, India has higher marks than many-many other countries and of course there is always a desire to see improvement and more transparency. Transparency is not so much a problem in India. It is more the majority shareholders wanting to do things their own way and not thinking about what is good for overall for the minority investors. But they are willing to listen and that is a very good sign.

We are seeing pockets of selling across Asia by foreign investors. Do you believe foreign investors at this point in time are beginning to worry a little about valuations that they want to take some cash off the table?

Mark Mobius: They always worry. Bull markets are built on a wall of worry. You see that all the time people say ‘Oh! God it has gone up by 30%-40%-50%, let me take some profits’. So you have that these corrections along the way. That does not change the basic scenario of a secular bull market that we are in. These bull markets last longer than bear markets. This is one of the things that we have noticed with emerging markets. Generally since 1988, we have had 3 major bear markets and by bear markets I mean a decline of 30% or more. But these bear markets were very short in duration. The bull markets last much, much longer and I believe that is the case now.
If the US does raise interest rates, would you worry that there is going to be a bit of a pullback in emerging markets by the middle of next year?

Yes, if you have a situation where interest rates in US treasuries move up dramatically and thereby impact the rest of the world, then of course there will be concern. But we must look at the record. If you look at the record of interest rates - both real and nominal – and markets, the correlation is not that high. So we have to be careful because you cannot take a one variable like that and say okay interest rates go up then markets will be in trouble, no. But there will be certainly some concerns and you will wonder ‘Hey! is this over because interest rates in the US are going up’.

If that does happen and when that does happen, would you change your view on exporter companies out of Asia because currencies will have dropped in reaction to US interest rate hikes?

Of course yes, if the currencies – let’s say the US dollar – get substantially stronger and the emerging market currencies stay where they are, there will be a boom in exports. It goes same for Europe, for the Euro. That is certainly something we have to look at - whether it is going to happen and what the probabilities are. I am not so sure.

Would you say that Japan is going to be the biggest beneficiary of an interest rate hike in the US?

Yes, they would probably benefit from that happening. Japan is now benefiting more from China as exports from Japan are greater to China than to the US or to Europe. What happens in China is going to have more impact on what happens in Japan. If China is able to continue exports to the US, that indirectly helps Japan.

You have been a pioneer in identifying some of the attractive frontier markets across the world. You have talked about Nigeria being an extremely attractive market. Which are the frontier markets are you seeing value in now?

The one that really has good value is Vietnam. The problem in Vietnam is that liquidity is very-very poor. Kazakhstan is another market which we think is quite attractive. In Africa, there are many countries like Botswana, Ghana, Kenya and in North Africa you have Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt which are very interesting. In the Middle Eastern markets, you have got Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi - these are very interesting markets. It is quite amazing to see how many markets there are in the frontier arena. In Romania, we have just established an office in Bucharest and that is a very interesting market as well.
Would you agree that frontier markets, while they do look attractive from the outside, the ability to go in as a large investor is not there because these markets are so small, so illiquid and so over regulated?

I would not say about over regulated. Many of these are under regulated. There is not a problem on regulation so much in these markets. Since there are so many of these markets, we are able to nibble at all these different times in different ways and our frontier markets have grown dramatically. We are now managing over 800 million and nearing the 900 million mark. We haven’t had any problem in investing the money. So it is quite remarkable how these markets have blossomed and they will be growing with more IPOs and more activity.

You did mention about $900 million in frontier markets, what percentage is that of your total portfolio allocation and do you see that $900 million progressively increasing over the next few years?

It is increasing, this amount is increasing. Of course, it is a very small amount of the total that we have in emerging markets. So it is a fraction of what we have.

There are some who argue that frontier markets aren’t too different from emerging markets because volatility in these markets is - if not identical - fairly close to each other. You have the issues of liquidity, you have the issues of getting in and getting out of those markets not being so easy. Is that something you agree with or would you identify frontier markets as a different class and emerging markets as a different class?

Frontier markets of course is a subset of emerging markets. But they are very different. The correlation between frontier markets and emerging markets is very low. Unlike emerging markets and developed markets, the correlation is much higher and the behaviour is very different. It is quite remarkable how different they are. So that will probably be the case for sometime to come because markets like Nigeria, Kenya, Vietnam, Kazakhstan are really new and growing markets and their behaviour is going to be very different from the developed and emerging markets.","
The influx of money post QE2 is significant, impacting emerging markets and commodities. Concerns arise about potential asset bubbles in India. The US may not object to emerging markets checking currency rises, as it benefits from their bond purchases. While an appreciation of emerging market currencies might not address global imbalances, a rapid rise could lead to inflation in the US and Europe. Potential asset bubbles in Asia are a concern, and the volatility is higher due to increased money and a larger derivative market. However, a gradual currency appreciation is seen as positive."

“This guy is going to lead you for a long time. He is going to do a great job. He has got everything that is required (to succeed),” Kohli said in his address to RCB’s loyal fans at the team’s Unbox event here on Monday.
“It feels amazing to be back. The excitement and happiness is like every other season. I have been here for 18 years and absolutely love RCB. We have an amazing squad this time around. Lot of talent in the team. I am personally very excited about this season,” Kohli added.
Patidar, who succeeded Faf du Plessis as captain after the South African was released ahead of the IPL 2025 auction, said it was an honor to lead RCB. “Legends like Virat bhai, Ab de Villiers, Chris Gayle have played for RCB. I grew up watching them. From the start I have loved the franchise a lot. I am more happy that I got a new role to lead one of the biggest teams (in T20 cricket),” said Patidar, who has also played for India.
The Indore-born batter had made a dramatic re-entry into the IPL mid-way through the 2022 season as a replacement player for Luvnith Sisodia in RCB after having previously played four games in 2021 for the franchise but was not retained later that year.
In eight games in 2022, Patidar aggregated 333 runs including an unbeaten 112 off 54 balls in the IPL Eliminator win against Lucknow Super Giants. Patidar later missed the 2023 season due to an Achilles Heel injury but was retained by the franchise for another season. In 2024, Patidar was at his destructive best for RCB, smashing 33 sixes while amassing 395 runs in 15 matches.","Virat Kohli has backed newly-appointed RCB captain Rajat Patidar to lead the team for many years, expressing confidence in his abilities. Speaking at RCB’s Unbox event, Kohli, who led the franchise for over a decade before stepping down in 2021, praised Patidar’s potential and expressed excitement for the upcoming IPL season.

Patidar, who replaced Faf du Plessis as captain, called it an honor to lead RCB, a team he has admired since childhood. The Indore-born batter made a significant impact in IPL 2022, scoring 333 runs in eight games, including a stunning 112* in the Eliminator. Despite missing the 2023 season due to injury, he was retained by RCB and delivered a strong performance in 2024, hitting 33 sixes and amassing 395 runs in 15 matches.

On January 14, 2013, a seven-year-old girl was raped in her school toilet in Mormugao taluka.
After the suspect, based on a sketch, was not traceable, a CBI team went to West Bengal and arrested him.The suspect was a native of Murshidabad, West Bengal, and was living in Goa.
Sources said that the arrested suspect’s fingerprints did not match that of the accused.
Earlier, Goa police and the CBI released three different sketches of the accused, but could not trace him.
After no breakthrough, the CBI had approached the judicial magistrate first class (JFMC), Vasco, in 2017 seeking permission to close the case. But the survivor’s parents objected to the closure and the CBI had to restart the investigations.
The CBI had carried out DNA tests on over 14 suspects and put eight suspects through the lie detection test.
It also did fingerprint matching of nine suspects, but did not get favourable results, and had filed the closure report.
It was transferred to Goa police’s crime branch on the same day.
In May 2013, an NGO demanded that the case be handed over to the CBI, as the local crime branch had failed to make any detection.
Agreeing to the demand, the state government accorded consent and after the Union home ministry issued a notification transferring the case, the CBI took over the case in September 2013.
In its closure report, the CBI had said that the culprit was not traceable despite all efforts.
The CBI had conducted polygraph tests on two persons suspected to have known the accused in the rape case.
The CBI officials especially flew down from Delhi and conducted the lie detection test on these two persons at the CBI’s Bambolim office.

4b12db899a18149e19981327cbe11862,"[DOC 1] Bharatiya Janata Party’s controversial MLA Surendra Singh, on Wednesday termed Congress president Rahul Gandhi as  ‘Ravana’ and his sister and Congress general secretary for UP East, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, as ‘Surpanakha’.

The BJP MLA said that the Congress was a ‘sinking ship’ and it managed to defeat the BJP in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in the recent assembly polls because of resentment in a section of society over Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes Act.

He claimed that the Congress had no political standing anymore and it would not win anywhere else in the coming Lok Sabha elections.

Taking a swipe at the Congress, Singh said that as Ravana sent his sister Surpanakha to defeat Ram, Rahul too had pitched Priyanka to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Earlier, the MLA had supported his party colleague and MLA Sadhana Singh, who created a political furore by using derogatory language against Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati at a public meeting at Chandauli.

Defending Sadhna Singh, Surendra Singh had said that Mayawati’s decision to join hands with Samajwadi Party after the infamous 1995 Lucknow Guest House incident proved that she had no self-respect.","Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Surendra Singh likened Congress President Rahul Gandhi to 'Ravana' and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to 'Surpanakha,' denouncing Congress as a 'sinking ship.'

Singh dismissed Congress's electoral prospects, alleging it lacks political standing. He mocked Rahul for deploying Priyanka to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi, drawing parallels to the Ramayana.

4b55e4779a3d9fc306ef240d0c8cb015,"[DOC 1] The National Population Register (NPR) form used at the trial stage in September 2019, seeking details of the “place of birth of father and mother”, is likely to be finalised as the authorities did not receive any adverse feedback from a sample set of respondents.

Around 30 lakh people responded to the “pretest” form that was used to collect data in 74 districts. It sought details on 21 parameters, especially the “ place of birth of father and mother , the last place of residence”, along with Aadhaar (optional), voter ID card, mobile phone and driving licence numbers.

The present NPR has a database of 119 crore residents.

“None of the respondents gave an adverse feedback. The final form is likely to remain the same,” the official said.

Another official said families will be informed in advance about the visit of an enumerator so that the documents of all individuals are readily available for verification.

“If there are 15 members in the family, the enumerators would give them a prior notice, so that documents of all are available when the field visit is undertaken. The enumerator will see the documents,” the official said.

The NPR training manual said the existing database would be updated by verifying the details of all respondents through house-to-house enumeration.

The NPR exercise conducted first in 2010 and subsequently updated in 2015 , collected details on the following 15 parameters only — name of person, relationship to head of household, father’s name, mother’s name, spouse’s name (if married), sex, date of birth, marital status, place of birth, nationality (as declared), present address of usual residence, duration of stay at present address, permanent residential address, occupation/activity and educational qualification.
Along with census
The fresh NPR data will be conducted from April- September 2020 along with the decennial Census exercise.

West Bengal and Kerala have issued orders that they will not allow NPR in their States. Chief Ministers of other Congress-ruled States have also declined to update NPR amid apprehensions that it will be followed by the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Though the government has denied that there was any link between NPR and the NRC, the Rules inserted in 2003 to the Citizenship Act, 1955 , clearly provides for the creation of NRC that will flow from data gathered in the NPR .

The Rules empower local officials to decide on a person’s citizenship status. The Assam-specific NRC, conducted under the supervision of Supreme Court, had excluded 19 lakh out of 3.29 crore residents. There are apprehensions that people will have to dig out old documents to prove their residency in India on the lines of the exercise conducted in Assam.

No documents need to be produced for NPR: Union Home Ministry
The Union Home Ministry on Wednesday clarified that no person needs to submit any documents during the house-to-house survey for updating the National Population Register and that information provided by individuals would be accepted and recorded.

Through a series of tweets, the Ministry sought to deny the thrust of a report in The Hindu headlined NPR trial form gets government nod for rollout that appeared on January 1.

The Ministry spokesperson’s official Twitter handle said: “The line taken by the story is incorrect, without taking into account the factual position for conducting NPR.” went on to say: “The story incorrectly quotes government officials that ‘respondents to NPR exercise will get time to provide papers’ and ‘families would need to dig out old documents and ensure that such documents are readily available for verification & enumerators would see those documents’.” It added: “The story ignores Government’s stated position that no individual will be required to submit any document to any authority or enumerator visiting his/her household for NPR survey. Information provided by the individual would be accepted and recorded accordingly.”","The National Population Register (NPR) is set to finalize its form after a trial stage in September 2019. Around 30 lakh people responded to the pretest form, which collected data on various parameters including the place of birth of parents and last place of residence. The finalized form is likely to remain unchanged as no adverse feedback was received. The NPR data collection will occur from April to September 2020 alongside the Census. However, West Bengal and Kerala have refused to implement NPR, citing concerns about its potential connection to the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The Union Home Ministry clarified that no documents need to be produced during the NPR survey, as information provided by individuals will be accepted and recorded."

Hero Honda plans to invest Rs 572 crore for expanding manufacturing capacities and also diversify into making scooters.
This move, industry observers say, will pit the company head-on once again with arch rival Bajaj.
Hero Honda has proposed this fresh investment in an application filed with government. The new product category â€” scooters â€” has been introduced in renewed licence and technical assistance (LTA) arrangement between the Munjal family-promoted Hero Group and Honda Motor.

According to sources, the company intends to produce mainly non-geared scooters, a growing segment in the country''s two-wheeler market today.

The scooter production, sources added, is expected to commence in its third plant that the company is planning to set up within a year. Hero Honda has already zeroed down on a few locations â€” including Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh â€” for setting up this plant.

The new plant, the source added, will have the flexibilty to produce both motorcycles and scooters. It has also proposed to add 1,500 jobs as part of this expansion and diversification.


Hero Honda forays into scooter-making at a time when its Japanese parent Honda is preparing to ride into the Indian motorcycle market. Honda â€” through its wholly-owned subsidiary Honda Motorcycles and Scooters â€” is set to launch its bike by Diwali.

Addressing a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament to kick-start the Budget session, she extended olive branch to Pakistan by stating that New Delhi was prepared to explore a meaningful relationship with the neighbouring country if it seriously addressed the threat of terrorism and took effective steps to prevent terrorist activities against India.

In her hour-long address, the President outlined the broad policies of the Manmohan Singh Government during its second term and what all it proposes to do in the coming months.

She maintained a stoic silence on the Telangana issue that has sharply divided members from Andhra Pradesh in Parliament.

Talking at length on security situation, Patil said the overall internal security, law and order and the communal situation remained largely under control during 2009. Infiltration of terrorists from across the line of control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir has gone up. Even then, the security situation has improved significantly in the state as well as in the North-East, but Left wing extremism continued to be a significant cause of concern.

As top leaders from both the ruling coalition as well as the Opposition parties heard the President with rapt attention, she said the government was committed to bringing forth legislation to ensure food security. Despite a significant increase in the procurement process of food grains, central issue prices for purposes of public distribution have been kept constant since 2002. The import regime for essential commodities has been liberalised. The government has decided to release 30 lakh tonnes of wheat and rice in the open market over the next two months, and release 5 lakh tonnes of wheat and 2 lakh tones of rice through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation and the National Consumers’ Federation and their affiliated cooperatives to benefit consumers at the retail level. The government has also released an additional allocation of 36 lakh tones of wheat and rice for distribution to card holders over the months of January and February.

Touching a controversial issue that has sharply divided Parliament, Patil said the government was committed to ensuring early passage of the Women’s reservation Bill.","President Pratibha Patil reaffirmed the UPA government's focus on controlling inflation and strengthening national security. She expressed willingness for dialogue with Pakistan if it curbs terrorism. Addressing Parliament, she highlighted progress in internal security, food security measures, and support for the Women’s Reservation Bill, while avoiding the contentious Telangana issue."

In doing so, India’s principal opposition party has thrown a major dampener over the outcome of the talks.

BJP chief Nitin Gadkari, in an exclusive interview with The Tribune Editor-in-Chief Raj Chengappa here today, said: “India should not hold any talks with Pakistan — our party is against it. The talks will have no relevance as Pakistan has done nothing to end cross-border terrorism. By resuming talks with Pakistan, the UPA government would be repeating a big mistake.”

The BJP chief, who was in the city to address a series of rallies, charged the UPA government with using dilatory tactics and playing vote bank politics over the issue of carrying out the death sentence delivered to Kasab by the special court for his role in the Mumbai 26/11 attack. He said: “This government is always talking big but it has no courage to fight terrorism. The government has no guts to punish Afzal Guru though the Supreme Court has already given its judgment. It must now move fast on Kasab’s verdict and act on it.”

Gadkari was critical about the performance of the UPA government, which is set to complete a year of its second term on May 22. He said the government had failed to curb inflation and had totally failed “on internal and external security in terms of tackling terrorism and Naxalites. Overall, I would give it 0 out of 10 for its performance and 10 out of 10 on corruption.”

He was on the defensive though about his party’s flip-flop over developments in Jharkand and justified the BJP indulging in horse-trading to form a government there, saying it’s “in the wider interest of stability for Jharkand and to avoid President’s Rule.”

On the party’s failure of the cut motion in the Lok Sabha, the BJP chief accused the UPA government of misusing the CBI to blackmail the other opposition parties into compliance.","BJP chief Nitin Gadkari strongly opposed India resuming talks with Pakistan, citing continued cross-border terrorism. He criticized the UPA government’s inaction on executing Kasab and Afzal Guru, and rated its performance poorly on security and inflation.

695ac26bdd2e23e5e286bd56b8df21e3,"[DOC 1] Nepal has an unenviable record of air tragedies on its mountains but course correction is missing

In an eerie reminder of a crash that occurred on May 14, 2012, a plane flying from Pokhara to Jomsom crashed near the Jomsom Airport, killing 15 people. Ten years later, in the same month and on the same route, another aircraft apparently hit a mountainside, crashed and snuffed out 22 lives. The 2012 flight was operated by Agni Air, Nepal’s domestic airliner, flying a Dornier Do-228 plane. This time, it was a turboprop Twin Otter 9N-AET aircraft belonging to Tara Air. The airline came into business in 2009 to help develop rural Nepal, and claiming to be the “newest and biggest” airline service provider in the Nepalese mountains. However, air tragedies are nothing new in Nepal’s hilly terrain. These are frequent and inquiry commissions are set up after each such accident but hardly any tangible steps are taken for course correction. For one, most of the aircraft in service are old planes, some of these being a second-hand buy. Another reason is the lack of modern navigational and technical facilities to aid the pilots and the Air Traffic Controller during inclement weather, which is a rather frequent and unpredictable phenomenon in any mountainous area.

The airlines, in their desire to make a quick buck, resort to underhand tactics like hiring semi-qualified staff to operate the almost-ramshackle planes. Nepal, home to eight of the world’s highest 14 mountains, including Everest, has an unenviable record of air accidents. In 2016, all 23 people aboard were killed when a plane of the same airline flying on the same route crashed soon after take-off. In March 2018, a US-Bangla Air crash occurred at the Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 51 people on board. Earlier, in September 2012, a Sita Air flight crashed while making an emergency landing at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 19 people. In the latest incident, the small plane with 22 people on board, including four Indians, flying on a popular tourist route went missing in the mountains of Nepal on Sunday. The aircraft, on a 15-minute flight from Pokhara to Jomsom, both popular destinations with foreign hikers who trek on mountain trails as well as Indian and Nepalese Hindu devotees who visit the revered Muktinath temple, lost contact with the ATC shortly after taking off. The crash took place at Thasang-2 in Mustang district at a height of 14,500 feet.","This article discusses the recent plane crash near Jomsom Airport in Nepal, highlighting the unfortunate recurrence of air tragedies in the region. The incident, involving a Tara Air turboprop Twin Otter aircraft, claimed the lives of 22 people on a popular tourist route from Pokhara to Jomsom. The article notes that Nepal has a history of frequent air accidents in its hilly terrain, and various inquiry commissions have been set up after such incidents. The author points out contributing factors to these accidents, including the use of old planes, some of which are second-hand purchases, and the lack of modern navigational and technical facilities, particularly crucial in unpredictable mountainous weather. The desire for quick profits leads airlines to employ semi-qualified staff to operate aging aircraft. The article reflects on Nepal's air safety challenges and the need for tangible measures to address these issues and prevent future accidents. The tragic history of air accidents in Nepal, including previous crashes on the same route, is outlined to underscore the urgency of addressing safety concerns in the aviation sector."

The year was 1998. Emerging markets on Tuesday look a lot like they did back then. Yet there have been key changes that could help most of them escape full-blown crises. Here’s a look at the similarities and differences between now and then.

Similarities:

Falling oil prices

Crude has dropped 48% since June to about $55 a barrel, squeezing exporters from Venezuela to Russia and Nigeria. Credit default swaps show a 97% probability that Venezuela will default on its bonds within five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The Russian economy, which is under sanctions by the US and the European Union over the Ukraine conflict, will contract as much as 4.7% next year if oil remains at $60, the central bank said.


Currencies sink

A Bloomberg index tracking 20 of the most traded emerging- market currencies fell to the lowest since 2003 on 15 December. The ruble tumbled past 64 per dollar for the first time, Turkey’s lira fell to an all-time low while Indonesia’s rupiah retreated to levels last seen in 1998.

During the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, countries from Thailand to Malaysia capitulated on defending their currency pegs, leading the Thai baht to lose half its value in six months. South Koreans lined up in the streets to donate gold jewellery to help the government refill their depleting foreign reserves amid the currency slump.

Fed policy

The US Federal Reserve is laying the ground for its first interest rate increase since 2006, threatening to drain capital from developing nations. The World Bank estimated last year that private capital inflows to developing nations could drop 50% should long-term US bond yields rise one percentage point.


Countries with large current account deficits, including Turkey, South Africa and Brazil, are vulnerable, according to Credit Agricole CIB. So are nations such as Malaysia, where foreign investors account for 30% of local government debt. A series of Fed rate increases in the mid-1990s helped trigger the run on Asian currencies that would in turn lead to Russia’s default.

Differences:

Flexible exchange rates

Developing countries have allowed their exchange rates to fluctuate, moving away from the fixed exchange-rate regimes prevailing during the crisis in the late 1990s. While weaker currencies fuel inflation, they can also stimulate economic growth by making exports cheaper.

Foreign reserves

Developing countries’""foreign reserves dwarf the amount they had in the late 1990s, which will help them weather the volatility in financial markets. As a group, emerging markets hold $8.1 trillion, compared with $659 billion in 1999, according to data compiled by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).


Debt

Instead of borrowing in dollars, the governments now mostly raise financing in local currencies, allowing them to pay back the debt without having to draw down foreign reserves.

External debt amounted to 26% of developing nations’ gross domestic product last year, down from 40% in 1999, the IMF data show.

One caveat is that companies have replaced governments as a source of concern on debt issuance. Corporations in developing countries sold about $375 billion of international debt between 2009 and 2012, more than double the amount in the four years before the 2008 financial crisis, the Bank for International Settlements said in September.

Interest rates

While rates are rising in some developing nations, they remain a fraction of the levels seen in 1998. Russia raised its benchmark rate 6.5 percentage points to 17% effective 16 December at a late-night meeting. Some short-term rates soared over 100% back in 1998.


In Brazil, policy makers have raised benchmark rates to 11.75%. That’s still less than half the rate levels from 1998. Bloomberg","The current economic landscape in emerging markets bears similarities to the 1998 financial crisis, with falling oil prices, sinking currencies, and the potential for adverse effects from US Federal Reserve policy. However, there are key differences that may mitigate the impact. Unlike the late 1990s, developing countries now have flexible exchange rates, larger foreign reserves, and reduced external debt as a percentage of GDP. Governments also borrow in local currencies rather than dollars. While challenges persist, these differences suggest that emerging markets are better positioned to weather potential crises than they were in 1998."

21abe8f55cb4e770eca0f3879c5003c4,"[DOC 1] GANDHINAGAR: BJP is witnessing dissidence and protests after it announced candidates’ list for the Gujarat assembly polls.

Several party workers reached Kamalam, the swanky headquarters of the ruling party in the outskirts of Gandhinagar, on Sunday and “warned BJP of consequences if their demands aren’t met”. Also, many workers took to the streets to protest either the dropping of the sitting MLAs or repeating the unpopular ones.

BJP workers admit that while post-ticket allocation resentment is not new to the party, the scale of protest unleashed this time around is unprecedented. “Absence of Modiji has emboldened the ambitious candidates,” said a mid-level Ahmedabad-based worker.

The supporters of heavyweight Rajput leader IK Jadeja flocked Kamalam on Sunday after he was denied a ticket from Wadhwan. BJP has fielded Dhanji Patel, a first-timer. While Dhanji belongs to the same Leuva sub-caste as Hardik, Jadeja maintains the people of Dhrangadhra and workers of Wadhwan wanted him as BJP candidate, but lost patience when an outsider was fielded by the party. Jadeja, however, reiterated that he was very much in BJP.


But Liladhar Vaghela — BJP MP from Patan — has threatened to resign if his son Dilip is not fielded from Deesa in North Gujarat. Another BJP MP from Panchmahal, Prabhatsinh Chauhan, has decided to file his nomination papers as an independent from Kalol after his request for a ticket for his wife was turned down.

Workers from Nikol in Ahmedabad too thronged Kamalam on Sunday protesting the repeat of Ahmedabad BJP city chief Jagdish Panchal from the constituency. Alleging arrogance and high handedness on the part of Panchal, the workers demanded that he be dropped.

Resentment was also felt in Naroda in Ahmedabad, where the supporters of sitting MLA Nirmala Wadhwani protested her dropping.","The announcement of candidates for Gujarat's assembly polls has sparked dissension within the BJP. Party workers protest at the Gandhinagar headquarters over dropped or unpopular choices. Notable leaders, like IK Jadeja, face dissent, while MPs Liladhar Vaghela and Prabhatsinh Chauhan express dissatisfaction. The BJP contends with internal discord ahead of elections."
816fda1f3141073bbc1c8fa11c3aba5e,"[DOC 1] BOSTON, January 27 (PTI):  The heroic response by employees of Mumbai’s landmark Taj Hotel during the 26/11 terror attacks is now a case study at Harvard Business School that focuses on the staff’s selfless service for its customers and how they went beyond their call of duty to save lives. The multimedia case study ‘Terror at the Taj Bombay: Customer-Centric Leadership’ by HBS professor Rohit Deshpande documents “the bravery and resourcefulness shown by rank-and-file employees” during the attack.
The study mainly focuses on “why did the Taj employees stay at their posts (during the attacks), jeopardising their safety in order to save hotel guests” and how can that level of loyalty and dedication be replicated elsewhere. A dozen Taj employees died trying to save the lives of the hotel guests during the attacks. “Not even the senior managers could explain the behaviour of these employees,” Deshpande is quoted as saying in HBS Working Knowledge, a forum on the faculty’s research and ideas. Deshpande said even though the employees “knew all the back exits” in the hotel and could have easily fled the building, some stayed back to help the guests.
“The natural human instinct would be to flee. These are people who instinctively did the right thing. And in the process, some of them, unfortunately, gave their lives to save guests.” A documentary-style account of events, the case includes video interviews with hotel staff and footage of the attack. It shows how leadership displayed by people in the bottom rank to the top levels in the organisational hierarchy helped in saving lives. It also focuses on the hotel’s history, its approach to recruiting and training employees, the Indian culture’s “guest is God” philosophy and how the hotel would recover after the attacks. Another key concept of the study is that in India and the developing world, “there is a much more paternalistic equation between employer and employee that creates a kinship.”
Terming it as one of the “hardest cases” he has worked on, Mumbai-native Deshpande said it was hard to see people confront their trauma again. “We objectify it, keep emotion at a distance, but after 15 minutes of questions with a video camera in a darkened room, there are deeper, more personal reflections of what happened,” he says in the HBS Working Knowledge. Deshpande said Taj employees felt a sense of loyalty to the hotel as well as a sense of responsibility to the guests. He cites the example of a general manager who insisted on staying put and help direct a response to the attack even after learning that his wife and sons had died in a fire on the hotel’s top floor.
“Nothing in the employees’ training could have prepared them for such an unprecedented situation,” Deshpande said. Deshpande has taught the case in the School’s Owner/President Management Executive Education programme. It can also be taught as an example of managing the post-crisis recovery of a flagship corporate brand, he added.","The heroic response of Taj Hotel employees during the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai has become a case study at Harvard Business School. Titled 'Terror at the Taj Bombay: Customer-Centric Leadership,' the study by HBS professor Rohit Deshpande explores the bravery and selflessness exhibited by staff in saving guests' lives. It focuses on the loyalty and dedication of employees who stayed at their posts despite the danger. The case study also delves into the hotel's history, employee recruitment, training, and the recovery process after the attacks, highlighting the unique employer-employee relationship in India."

He resigned from the railways in 1950, in his late 30s, and became a full-time writer. He was a prolific writer. His novels were expansive sagas of individual lives caught up in a world of enormous social and political change.

Shaheb Bibi Golam, the Hindi version of which was acted in and produced by Guru Dutt, is a story set against a decadent feudal society and revolves around “Chhoto Bou” (played by Meena Kumari in the Hindi version), a woman married into a zamindar family who yearns for love, romance and the fullness of life, which elude her.

4d03ec85aeed6f0d449fb372835a2b5a,"[DOC 1] After the 26/11, the coastal security agencies have geared up to take stringent measures to ensure that another Kuber is not repeated. The decision on the same lies with the state government and the central government. One of the pertinent security measures which is being discussed suggests that 10 nautical miles across the International Maritime Border line should be made a No-fishing-Zone. In some of the countries like in the USA fishing is allowed only in certain coastal belts taking security into consideration. Security agencies also suggested that No-Fishing -Zone should also be introduced at harbour. According to them, this step will ensure zero chance to interface with bigger vessels.
 
 According to the information available with the Newsline, the number of fishing trawlers that have trespassed the International Maritime Border Line and entered the Pakistan waters increased to 800 trawlers in 2007, compared to 200 in 2004. Since 2005, as many as 2,495 Indian fishing trawlers have trespassed entered Pakistan waters. Among them, over 300 fishing trawlers are still with Pakistan and over 490 odd fishermen are in their custody. The IMB line is 85 miles away from Okha and 45 nautical miles away from Jhakau.
 
 The other important input passed on to the state by the coastal security agencies is that most of these trawlers were found to be fitted with GPS and high-end communication kits and were communicating with each other while sailing in Pakistan waters.
 
 Another pertinent measure that the security agencies suggested is cancellation of permits, if any fishing trawler crosses the IMB line to Pakistan waters. According the senior officials, Kuber had trespassed 70 nautical miles into Pakistan water. Kuber's GPS had recorded its location 10 nautical miles near Karachi coastline, they said. To prevent these kinds of incidents, only measure that should be taken is to deprive the sailors of diesel subsidy, if they are found to have trespassed into the neighbouring countries' waters.","After the 26/11 attacks, coastal security agencies have taken stringent measures to prevent another Kuber trespassing the International Maritime Border Line (IMB) into Pakistan's waters.

access to an important life-saving medication for HIV patients across the globe.
The decision to reject the patent application on the important combination drug, Lopinavir/Ritonavir filed by Abbot
Laboratories was given by the Indian patent office here during the weekend and it is a major victory to millions of HIVpositive patients around the globe, according to NGOs working with affected patients.
The Indian patent office has put a halt to the multi-national Abbott Laboratories patenting and said it was not an
invention.
""India, the world's leading supplier of affordable medicines, can now supply this drug to patients across the globe who
are desperately waiting for treatment. This combination drug is considered to be the frontline of defense for HIV positive
patients who have failed to stay healthy with the first round of medicines available currently,"" Tahir M Amin, Director of
Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK), one of those who initiated legal action against the US company
told PTI today in a communication from New York.
""This ground-breaking victory for patients sets an important precedent to stop pharmaceutical companies from gaming
the patent system, marking a new era of hope for millions of HIV people across the world,"" Amin said.
I-MAK was one of the opponents from US and others were Indian pharma companies like Cipla (Mumbai), Matrix

","India's rejection of a patent application from Abbott Laboratories for the drug combination Lopinavir/Ritonavir has significant implications for global access to HIV treatment. The decision by the Indian patent office in Mumbai over the weekend has been hailed as a victory for millions of HIV-positive patients worldwide, particularly by NGOs involved in patient advocacy.

Abbott Laboratories' patent application was denied on the grounds that the drug combination did not constitute a new invention. This ruling clears the way for India, known as a major supplier of affordable medicines, to continue producing and supplying this critical medication to patients globally. Lopinavir/Ritonavir is considered essential for HIV-positive individuals who have not responded well to initial treatment options currently available.

Tahir M Amin, Director of Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK), based in New York, emphasized the importance of this decision in preventing pharmaceutical companies from manipulating patent laws. He sees it as a landmark victory that will set a precedent for ensuring broader access to essential medications, offering renewed hope to millions affected by HIV.

Among the opponents to Abbott Laboratories' patent application were not only international organizations like I-MAK but also prominent Indian pharmaceutical companies such as Cipla, Matrix Laboratories, and Okasa Pharmaceuticals. Their collective efforts underscored the global significance of this decision in promoting affordable access to life-saving treatments."

The four astronauts are scheduled to undock from the ISS on Monday, July 14, at 4.35pm IST, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a statement.

According to ISRO, following a series of orbital manoeuvres after undocking Crew Dragon spacecraft is expected to splash down near the coast of California on July 15, 2025, at 3 pm IST.

“Post splashdown, the Gaganyatri will undergo a rehabilitation program (about seven days) under supervision of Flight Surgeon to adapt back to Earth’s gravity,” Isro said in an update on the Axiom-4 mission.

Isro paid approximately ₹550 crore for Shukla’s travel to the ISS — an experience that will help the space agency in planning and execution of its human spaceflight programme, Gaganyaan, set to take to orbit in 2027.

“Isro’s flight surgeons are continuously monitoring and ensuring the overall health and fitness of the Gaganyatri through participation in private medical/psychological conferences. Gaganyatri Shubhanshu is in good health and in high spirit,” Isro said.

Shukla and the three other astronauts are expected to board the spacecraft at 2.25 pm IST, wear their space suits and carry out the necessary tests before they begin their journey to the Earth.

The ISS is orbiting the Earth at a speed of 28,000 kilometres per hour, and the spacecraft will initiate the autonomous undocking process to gradually slow down and re-enter the planet’s atmosphere for a splashdown off the coast of California.

“The Dragon spacecraft will return with more than 580 pounds of cargo, including NASA hardware and data from over 60 experiments conducted throughout the mission,” NASA said.

Axiom-4 mission commander Peggy Whitson said in a post on X: “Enjoying our last few days on the @Space_Station with rehydrated shrimp cocktails and good company! #Ax4.”

On the experiment front, Shukla worked on the microalgae experiment, deploying and stowing samples that could one day provide food, oxygen and biofuels for deep-space missions, Axiom Space said in a statement.

The resilience of the microalgae makes them a promising asset to sustain life beyond the Earth, it added.

Isro said of the seven homegrown microgravity experiments, four experiments have been successfully completed and three are nearing completion. The four completed include Indian strain of Tardigrades involving survival, revival, reproduction and transcriptome; Myogenesis studying the impact of space environment on human muscle cells; Sprouting of methi & moong seeds with relevance to crew nutrition; Cyanobacteria experiment studying the growth of two varieties with relevance to life support systems.

These are being readied for their journey back to earth for further analysis, said Isro.

The three experiments that are nearing completion include studying microalgae, crop seeds and Voyager Display. “These Indian-led microgravity experiments represent a significant leap in space science and technology, contributing critical knowledge to support Gaganyaan, Bhartiya Antariksha Station, and future planetary missions,” read Isro statement.

As the crew gets ready, NASA said the Dragon spacecraft will return with more than 580 pounds of cargo, including NASA hardware and data from over 60 experiments conducted throughout the mission.

On Saturday, the Ax-4 members will finalise science experiments including an electrical muscle stimulation study, testing suit fabrics that promote thermal comfort while exercising, and filming crew activities for a behavioral health study.

On Sunday, the quartet will begin packing science gear filled with research samples and loading personal items and other cargo inside Dragon for retrieval on Earth, read a statement from NASA.

The Editor was returning home along with his wife when the attack took place. The attackers were caught by his security personnel and were handed over to the police. Both Arnab and his wife Samia Goswami were unhurt in the attack.
Goswami in his complaint to police said, “Around 12.15 am when we reached Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, two men followed our car and tried to overtake.” These two attackers initially tried to identify the driver following which they stretched their arm pointing at him and then blocked his path. “The pillion rider hit the right side driver window several times and then, these attackers realised that the car window was up and they couldn’t break through and immediately, the pillion rider removed the liquid bottle from his pocket and threw liquid all over the car on the driver’s side where I was sitting,” said Goswami in his statement to police. He further added that while the two were shouting and abusing him in Hindi while making violent gestures, he had ducked his head towards the steering wheel and managed to get sight of the road ahead and pressed on the accelerator swerving to his left.
After he managed to get back on the road, Goswami said that when he saw on his read view mirror, the protection provided by the Mumbai police and his personal security guard had got hold of the two.The patrolling police from the NM Joshi Marg police station noticed that few people had gathered at a spot at Ganpatrao Kadam Marg. “When we went close to them and inquired, we learnt that the two had attacked Goswami,” said an official. They then called for a backup following which the two were taken to NM Joshi Marg police station.
The police then recorded the statement of Goswami following which a case was registered under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The two accused identified as Arun Borade and Prateek Mishra were arrested.
An investigator said, “We have learnt that they are affiliated with the youth Congress wing in Sion which we are trying to confirm. We are trying to get more information on them.”
On Thursday, an FIR was lodged against Goswami in Abohar, Punjab, under Sections 153-A, 153-B, 295-A, 594, 596 of the IPC and Section 67 of the IT Act after a complaint by Harmohinder Singh Grover, Chairman of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee Freedom Fighter Cell. The FIR was registered against Goswami for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Congress president Sonia Gandhi during his TV show.
Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary also lodged a complaint with the police for registration of an FIR against Goswami.
The Chhattisgarh unit of the Congress lodged a formal complaint against Goswami on Wednesday, and accused him of “deliberately making inflammatory statements” and using derogatory language against Sonia Gandhi in his show.
In Maharashtra, State Youth Congress (YC) president Satyajeet Tambe said he had filed a complaint against Goswami in Sangamner and instructed YC workers to file complaints in all districts. In Nagpur, State Power Minister Nitin Raut’s son Kunal, a YC office-bearer, filed a similar complaint. Reacting to the attack on Arnab, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said, “We condemn the attempt to attack Arnab Goswami. We condemn every attack on any journalist. This is against democracy and it is really ironical that those who preach tolerance have become so intolerant. Therefore we condemn this attempt. “We appeal to the collective wisdom that this is undemocratic and as per present law Police definitely takes action if there is a complaint,” ANI quoted Javadekar as saying.

The manager of the Nadumannur LP School near Kuttiadi organised a ganapathy homam on Tuesday evening.
The incident came to light after local residents, noticing vehicles inside the school compound during the night, entered the building.
The headmistress of the school denied any knowledge of the incident, and alleged that the school manager misled her to take the keys of her office. General Education Minister V Sivankutty on Wednesday sought a report from the department director on the incident.
The incident occurred around 7.30pm in Kayakkody panchayat. School manager Aruna and her son took the initiative in holding the ritual. Once the news spread, villagers, including CPM workers, gathered and protested against the “illegal” conduct of a religious ceremony in an aided school. When they contacted headmistress Sajitha T K, she denied any knowledge of the incident.
“The manager asked for the key to my office room to take some stuff related to the construction of the new building and I gave it. When I called the manager and her son Rudhish to stop the pooja after the local residents started protests, they said it’s almost done. They said no pooja was held during the Nava Rathri and this was part of the penance,” the headmistress said.
In a report submitted to the deputy director of education, Kozhikode, the Kunnummal assistant educational officer said the religious ritual was held at the school in violation of the rules.
After the protests broke out, police arrived on the scene and took the organisers into custody. They were released later.

""No suicide note was found in the room, but according to her father, S Narsimha Das, their poor financial condition might have driven his daughter to suicide. Though Latha was planning to pursue higher studies, her parents were not in a position to fund her,"" Hayathnagar inspector B Bhaskar told TOI.
The incident came to light when Latha's brother S Babu heard her cries. He immediately alerted his cousin Sahadev and shifted her to Osmania General Hospital in a 108 ambulance. She succumbed to burns at around 11.30 pm while undergoing treatment. A case was registered under section 174 (Suspicious death) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

The Nasa technology, dubbed Marsis, consisted of a radar sounder with a 40-metre antenna fitted to an orbiter. In 2007, it discovered the desert that covers Mars sat on enough frozen water to submerge the Red Planet.
It was then able to bounce radio waves 3.7km beneath the surface of Mars.

The same technology should be used in the deserts of Middle East and north Africa to search for hidden water, Nasa scientist Essam Heggy said.

The technology could detect water up more than half a mile beneath the dense deserts that cover much of the Middle East and north Africa, Eggy said.","Nasa scientists suggest replicating Mars is technology, used on Mars to find underground ice, to locate hidden water sources in Earth's deserts.

903d058465bd6eb93ad9a769217bbb96,"[DOC 1] NEW DELHI, Jan 9- Global captains of industry, economic experts and trade officials were today treated to a “swadeshi” view of globalisation, the mantra of the new millennium, by the External Affairs Minister, Mr Jaswant Singh here today.

The annual partnership summit of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which has its theme “Managing Globalisation in the New Millennium”, was told by the Minister not to approach the concept of globalisation with the “arrogance of certainty” and the stage of managing it would come only after they understood the true definition of globalisation.

Mr Singh was modest in a way that he did not directly debunk the theme of the summit but posed questions that are bound to exercise the visiting delegates, who includes many Foreign Ministers and the Director General of the World Trade Organisation, during their deliberations over the next two days.

The Minister said the concept of globalisation was nothing new as even in the beginning of the last century there was one superpower in the form of Britain and gold was the standard currency of the world.

In the beginning of the 21st century, Britain has been replaced by the United States and it was the preminent economic and political influence over the world. In a way he said the present model of globalisation was sponsored by the United States.

Saying that he was no “soothsayer”, Mr Singh however, went on to add that this model would be challenged in the coming years as it was in the human nature to challenge any hegemonistic system.

He said the globalisation concept of today was benefiting only a few countries as just like a fly which goes after honey and not vinegar, investments were flowing to the rich countries and not the poor.

“When we approach globalisation we must approach it with more clarity and with the benefit of hindsight” he said.

Mr Singh said there were many unattended issues of globalisation and added that the first among them was the issue of nationalism. He questioned the very assumption of the existing model that nationalism would no longer be relevant and said the challenge therefore was how to interrelate nationalism with the demands of globalisation?

He pointed out that the existing global economic model had resulted in inequitable growth and the gap between the rich and the poor was increasing. He said of the six billion population in the world nearly four billion of them were living in abject poverty.

He said like the middle class in a society, which was the most assertive and dominant, the world too had a class of “middle countries” which he believed would challenge the existing system in times to come.

“Globalisation as we have experienced has not resulted in economic equality or opportunities and it has not helped in eliminating political discord in countries” Mr Singh said.

He said the management of globalisation would have to address the management of political discord.

Mr Singh said real globalisation could be said to have taken place only when Governments do not stand in the way of economic growth and resist the creative energies of human beings from being released.

In this regard he said the expansion of the knowledge based industry could be cited as a true example of globalisation as it was more equitable and wide spread across the world.

He disclosed that during the recent hijacking episode, one of the passengers with the help of his laptop computer had managed to get access to a person in China with the help of the Internet. The message was subsequently relayed to the Minister in New Delhi

He said one needs this kind of globalisation which knows no resistance, geographical borders and other hurdles.

Mr Singh said his Government would seek to strike a balance between globalisation and national needs. In this regard he spoke about giving priority to basic human needs like drinking water, health services and education.","**Summary:**

At the CII's annual Partnership Summit themed ""Managing Globalisation in the New Millennium,"" External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh presented a critical ""swadeshi"" perspective on globalisation. He urged industry leaders to understand globalisation deeply before managing it and warned against the ""arrogance of certainty."" Singh highlighted that today’s globalisation, led by the U.S., benefits mainly wealthy nations, widening global inequality. He stressed the importance of integrating nationalism with globalisation, addressing political discord, and ensuring equitable growth. Citing the knowledge industry and internet connectivity as true examples of inclusive globalisation, Singh emphasized the need for India to balance global economic integration with national priorities like water, healthcare, and education.

1c0848f60abad900b4e6afb87dc533f9,"[DOC 1] Instead of focusing on individual monuments or historical land marks, of which Delhi has an en viable number having been a cap ital city for ages under innumerable dynasties, India National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) proposes to create heritage circuits that would showcase each historical legacy in a better way .

The heritage circuit will acquaint tourists with the monumental edifices left behind by various dynasties, from the Ghors, Khiljis and Tughlaqs to the Sayyids, Lodis and Mughals and finally the British. These dynasties will come alive in seven circuits centring on, Mehrauli; Tughlaqabad and Surajkund; Hauz Khas and Safdarjung's Tomb; Nizamuddin; Purana Qila and Lodi Gardens; Shahjahanabad and New Delhi. The first one being developed is the Mehrauli circuit.

“The purpose of the heritage circuits is to ensure a tourist spends at least seven days in the city, dedicating a day to each circuit,“ explained an official. “By the end of the week, a tourist can leave with a better understanding of what has made Delhi what it is.""

The heritage circuits project is a collaboration between the tourism department and INTACH's Delhi chapter. “We are preparing a proposal for this Rs 100-crore project for the central government,“ said Delhi tourism minister Kapil Mishra. “We have ancient havelis, historical monuments, spiritual sites, museums and everything a world-class city needs. They just need to be promoted better.“

The project will get central funding under the union tourism ministry's “Swades Darshan“ scheme, whose aim is to develop theme-based tourism circuits across the country . So far 13 thematic circuits have been identified for development under this scheme: the North-East India Circuit, Buddhist Circuit, Himalayan Circuit, Coastal Circuit, Krishna Circuit, Desert Circuit, Tribal Circuit, Eco Circuit, Wildlife Circuit, Rural Circuit, Spiritual Circuit, Ramayana Circuit and Heritage Circuit.

In Mehrauli, the idea is to encourage visitors to go beyond the World Heritage Site of Qutub Minar and see other monuments and tombs in the area as also the iconic stepwells, Rajon ki Baoli and Gandhak ki Baoli. “The street character of Mehrauli village is also interesting and gives a glimpse of what life may have been like centuries ago,“ said an official.

The Tughlaqabad circuit will take visitors to the Surajkund lake from the fort, while the Hauz Khas circuit will encompass Hauz Khas fort, the lake, Be gumpuri masjid and Safdarjung's Tomb.The Shahjahanabad circuit will engage tourists in the landmarks in Old Delhi such as Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk and Red Fort.

The project proposes to develop architecturally iconic information centres with good signage and trained staff suitable for the needs of more visitors. “Most existing tourist information centres are old structures with no architectural design and often of little use to visitors,“ said an official. “Tourists use other unreliable sources to get information, and this can lead to being misguided or cheated.'' The new hubs will also exhibit city highlights and have kiosks for information and guidance, besides services like wi-fi, car hire and events calendar.
","The India National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) in collaboration with Delhi's tourism department is proposing heritage circuits to showcase the diverse historical legacies of Delhi. These circuits aim to immerse tourists in the city's rich heritage, spanning dynasties from the Ghors to the British. Each of the seven circuits, including Mehrauli, Tughlaqabad, Hauz Khas, Nizamuddin, Purana Qila, Lodi Gardens, Shahjahanabad, and New Delhi, will highlight monuments, tombs, forts, and other historical sites. The initiative, supported by a Rs 100-crore project under the Swades Darshan scheme, seeks to enhance tourism experiences with iconic information centers, improved signage, and visitor amenities like wi-fi and event calendars.

The Comrades Ultra Marathon started in 1921 after the first World War in South Africa with the tagline ‘ultimate human race’. Since inception, every year this gruelling race is organised alternately down (Pietermaritzburg to Durban) and up (Durban to Pietermaritzburg) run. This year’s edition was the down run for 90 km.

Commandant Kumar while narrating his journey, explained how he made it to the Comrades Ultra Marathon overcoming various obstacles. “The ‘Ultimate Human Race’ being a dream run for every distance runner, requires a year-long very high level of training, coaching, appropriate diet, discipline, and rest.

However, my situation was a bit different. My deployment in the highly sensitive zone of Kashmir left me with the only option of occasional self-training. The ultimate responsibility of a commander in an action-packed theatre reinforced my resolve to train harder for the race. My passion for the race connected me with great motivator.

David Gogin (toughest living being on the planet) for training. Learnt a lot from him through facebook and Instagram,” he said.

The Commandant said he had qualified for this race in 2020 but it was postponed due to Covid 19.

Notification with fresh qualifying time was released this year and I was able to register for the race by running my record time Marathon run in Jaipur this March, he added.

“After getting all clearance from the organisers I took leave and reached Durban. I had a chance to meet all the world class athletes. To my utter dismay, I found myself, through my interaction with them to be seriously lacking in quality training, but my confidence was at its peak, which I attained through the training I endured at my place of posting,” Commandant Kumar, who is posted in Jammu and Kashmir said.

Talking about his participation in the marathon, he said, “On the race day, I boarded a bus at about 0200 hrs for PMB from Durban expo and reached the venue. More than 1,6000 participants were rubbing shoulders to compete with each other. There were eight sections, A to H. B section has the disadvantage of starting late by a couple of minutes. The race started on time. I was in the B section behind A section. This marathon was on gun to gun shot. Approximately two km of my run I got pushed by a fellow runner due to the crowd of runners, and I fell down, someone trampled on me but somehow I managed to stand up and resume running.”

The first cut off time of 2 hours 40 minute was covered by me within one hour and then on I just cruised

ahead with the ever-enthusing cheers from the crowd, he said.

“Donning the T shirt with our national flag was an eternal inspiration for me. Spectators could see my name on the bottom of my T-shirt. Cheering sound of ‘India India, Come on India’ was all the staple food for my run and I kept on adding mile after mile to the distance I covered. The pride I experienced when the crowd was cheering with my name and my country’s name is beyond any expression. Reaching at Durban stadium was a

magical experience for me with a jam-packed stadium and that provided the ultimate push to me to hit the radiant. An unparalleled experience overall,” the Commandant said.

He further said, “It was a tough race than others races as the tagline says ‘Ultimate Human Race’. I felt blessed to put the Indian national flag on my shoulders at foreign land and can’t express my feelings in words. It was an amazing experience which I dedicated to cancer patients.”

He expressed gratitude to Commandant Indrani Yadav and Nilesh Bajaj who made his pre-event stay comfortable at Mumbai, besides to his organisation which stood behind his passion and gave him the chance to participate in this ultra marathon.","Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) Commandant Mukesh Kumar, recently participated in the Comrades Ultra Marathon 2022 in South Africa, feeling blessed to carry the Indian national flag in a foreign land.

Despite limited training opportunities, Kumar's passion and determination kept him motivated.

During the race, Kumar faced physical obstacles, including a fall and trampling, but he recovered and completed the run with confidence. The enthusiastic support from the crowd, chanting ""India, India,"" fueled his journey, providing an unparalleled experience. Kumar expressed his gratitude to colleagues and his organization for their support, dedicating his race to cancer patients."

India on Sunday recorded over 93,000 new Covid-19 cases in the previous 24 hours and the epidemic appeared only a day away from surpassing its previous daily record of 97,894 cases

Dr T. Sundararaman, global coordinator of the People s Health Movement and a former executive director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre, New Delhi, to deconstruct the second wave tells The Telegraph why it is difficult -- for now -- to predict the peak or duration of the second wave

Q: India s second Covid19 epidemic is growing even faster than during its first growth phase in July-August 2020. Was this anticipated? T. Sundararaman: Yes, the rate of spread is much more rapid that in the first wave. In the first wave it took India 61 days to go from about 25,000 cases to 92,000 cases. In the second wave it has taken just 22 days -- about one-third the time. The second wave should have been anticipated. Almost every country has had a second wave. But better-performing countries have had slower, flatter second waves

The Indian government appears to have been taken by surprise. It is not the government alone. Premature predictions from the scientific community that there would be no second wave and even a science and technology ministrysupported modelling effort confidently predicting the end of the pandemic in February have been misleading

Further, considerable levels of Covid-19-denial at the population and community level have contributed to this wave. Fortunately, after a cabinet secretary review meeting held on April 2, the government has expressed serious concern and directed a comprehensive response plan. But it would have been better if these measures had been done in four-monthlong trough between the waves

Q: Surveys in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, had indicated that 25 to 30 per cent of the population had already been infected by December. These prevalence figures along with declining counts in DecemberJanuary had stirred speculation that India may be approaching herd immunity. Why then has such a growth taken place? Sundararaman: The ""threshold level of herd immunity"" required to prevent Covid-19 spread is estimated to be anywhere between 60 per cent and 75 per cent. The exact level depends on the infectivity of the virus. Given that only 25 per cent of the population was immune in December, another 450 million would have to get infection if we were to reach a herd immunity level of 60 per cent through natural infections alone

Even with 1 per cent or less mortality rates, the number of deaths in the country would be unacceptably high. Achieving this herd immunity threshold level of 60 per cent does not mean elimination of the disease. It only means the epidemic shrinks vastly

New cases and deaths would continue and there could be outbreaks in sections of the population where infection or vaccination levels are low, like rural areas. Achieving herd immunity by infection -- as different from vaccinations -- was never a strategy of control and we were never near achieving it. Nor is it a credible explanation for the declining cases after the first wave

Q: What drives this second wave? Is it even possible to predict how high can the peak go or how long this wave will last? Sundararaman: In most countries the second wave has been larger than the first. In some there has been a smaller second peak but then a large third wave. Only New Zealand and a few other countries are an exception to this rule. Some countries that did well in the first round have done a good job of containing the second round. Like South Korea or Australia or Thailand -- but others like Brazil and Mexico or many European countries did not

Second and subsequent waves are not due to re-infections. Reinfection remains an exceptional event. Second waves are also unlikely to be due to mutant strains. Mutant strains in India have not been linked to increased infectivity (except to some extent in Pun- jab) and cannot explain the second wave in most countries. Blaming slackening of social distancing and masking, has some truth to it, but this is only a partial and inadequate explanation

Covid-19 infection spreads along social networks of people in frequent contact with each other. Within a geography like a village or city ward, there are multiple heterogeneous social networks in terms of inter-mixing, observance of rules, cultural prac- ` tices, health-seeking behaviour, and stigma. The interconnections between networks or clusters of people are semi-random, irregular and unpredictable

Thus, the disease can burn out within one cluster of the people by a combination of this group having more immune persons, and/or better control measures and health behaviours. But the disease continues to spread at low levels within non-immune persons in this cluster and to other clusters which are more susceptible. Soon, the density of cases within new clusters reaches levels that spark off outbreaks

A very good disease surveillance system should be able to detect and respond promptly to small potentially-containable cluster-level outbreaks -- but discovered too late these multiple outbreaks have snowballed into a second wave

Another reason for late discovery and response to small cluster outbreaks is the laxity in implementing test, track and treat protocols outside known hotspots and, surprisingly, extensive stigma and Covid-19-denial in the community. We have observed this in our field studies

Going by other countries experience, India s second wave is likely to be larger than its first, but how high it will go will depend both on effectiveness of control measures and on this unpredictable element of how it spreads within these inter-connected clusters

There is no accurate way to predict the peak or duration of this second wave. Maharashtra s cases are already more than double the September peak, and still rising. Perhaps this wave will subside by May, but as long as the majority of people are non-immune to the disease, and disease surveillance and response is sub-optimal, there would be even more waves to follow. Achieving adequate levels of herd immunity through scaling up vaccination is currently the most ethical and effective way to get out of this crisis situation -- but even this is not a standalone solution

` Q: Is the Centre better prepared to face the second wave as compared to the first? The Centre has attributed the spread to two factors (1) lack of precautions by people, (2) laxity in public health measures such as isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and testing with RT-PCR. How best can these be addressed? Sundararaman: There are some strengths India has acquired while managing the first wave. Firstly, vaccines are now available. We must urgently develop a vaccine delivery strategy that prioritises the population sub-groups by occupation and marginalisation, who are most at risk and from whom spread is most likely

Secondly, India has immensely expanded testing capacity -- from 1,200 tests and three testing centres to over 1.2 million tests per day and about 2,500 testing centres. Over 90 per cent of production is domestic. The challenge here is to address inequities in access due to both due price and non-price barriers

Another strength is that the necessary intensive care unit management skills and equipment and beds have increased considerably. But the concern is that this would still be short of requirements. Also, the cost and quality regulations in the private sector care are very poorly designed and implemented, and even patients with PM-JAY coverage are unable to access free hospital services

However, there is clearly much to be done on health behaviour. The failure to achieve behaviour change must not be blamed on people in a passive and helpless manner. By now the public health leadership should have gathered good evidence from research on the most effective approaches to behaviour change communication within specific circumstances in which people are living

An excessive reliance on law and order approaches is worse than ineffective. It leads to stigmatisation and denial of the problem that makes measures like contact tracing, isolation and testing even more difficult to practise. There are examples of community engagement for such purposes -- but this requires to be made the norm and scaled up rapidly

Q: The Centre says for each positive case, at least 20 close contacts should be traced and quarantined. For 80,000 new cases, that would mean tracing 1.6 million contacts across the country daily. Is that even possible? What is the best strategy forward? Sundararaman: A nationwide aggregation of the figure makes the task look impossible. But this average of 20 close contacts per case is an eminently achievable and essential objective. Centralised solutions like Aarogya Setu have failed quite miserably. To achieve this objective, the government must decentralise this task completely to local governments, to employers, to social security agencies and to other local organisations and associations -- all of which should be working with outreach workers of the public health system

Contact tracing is not a police function. It is the function of social workers who have the community s trust. Contact tracing remains relevant even when community transmission is established and disease is widespread -- since at the local level, the target is on limiting spread within clusters and across clusters. Physical barricading of houses and streets where there are infections in contrast, followed at local levels, is a useless if not a harmful measure

The government has an old weakness in failing to make communities active participants in health care. This has only worsened with home departments and general administration taking over these public health functions. But the second wave is an opportunity to get back the public into public health. `A very good disease surveillance system should be able to detect and respond promptly to small potentially-containable cluster-level outbreaks -- but discovered too late these multiple outbreaks have snowballed into a second wave `The failure to achieve behaviour change must not be blamed on people in a passive and helpless manner. By now the public health leadership should have gathered good evidence from research on the most effective approaches to behaviour change communication","India's second COVID wave is bigger and faster than the first, fueled by factors like premature claims of victory, COVID denial, weak surveillance, and limited immunity. Predicting its peak or duration is difficult.

Challenges include overwhelmed healthcare systems, access inequities, stigma, and poor behavior change communication. Solutions involve scaling up vaccination, strengthening surveillance, promoting effective communication, engaging communities in contact tracing, and addressing healthcare system weaknesses.

While India has some strengths like vaccine availability and increased testing capacity, much needs to be done on behavior change and community engagement. Decentralizing contact tracing and empowering local organizations are crucial steps forward."

21397df911e5d0cba9e67988399b91a7,"[DOC 1] Both the Economic Survey and the United Progressive Alliance government’s mid-term report card have rightly highlighted many significant achievements of the last three years, including an average gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8.6%. They, however, admit that the farm sector, which provides livelihood for 11.5 crore families, is in distress.


The report card correctly points out that the constraints in the supply of essential food items like wheat, pulses and oilseeds could upset macro economic stability. Having identified the problem in both human and statistical dimensions, the Budget fails to provide a strategy for agricultural renewal.

The Budget has provided funds for bringing 2.4 million hectares more under irrigation. The expansion of farm credit to cover an additional 50 lakh farmers, and total credit availability of Rs2.25 lakh crore are also welcome steps, although such figures alone are not going to prevent farmers affected by economic penury from committing suicides.

Provision has been made both for research and extension, and additional support has been indicated for strengthening the infrastructure of the agricultural universities at Pantnagar and Coimbatore. The proposal for restoring local water bodies and enhancing groundwater recharge is also a welcome one.

Unfortunately, there is no mention of steps to improve the efficiency of water use on the pattern of the proposal developed by the Union ministry of water resources for increasing income and production per drop of water.

The Economic Survey has rightly stressed that low productivity is one of the important causes of the economic distress of small farmers. It is not clear why one more demonstration model of water-harvesting is needed, while it is envisaged that the ‘more income per drop of water’ movement will cover every block of the country through agricultural universities, Indian Institutes of Technology, Water and Land Management Institutes, and institutions under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.


The time for ‘pilots’ is gone, and what we need is a movement like the one which triggered the Green Revolution of the sixties.

The need to revitalize the extension system has been given importance but the method proposed to be adopted is unlikely to yield the desired benefit. The Agriculture Technology Management Agency is chaired by the district collector who has many other jobs to attend to. There is no mention why the training and visit system, which was based on large World Bank loans, has not been successful.

The proposals to appoint a committee under Prof. Abhijit Sen to review forward trading, as well as another committee to review the impact of climate change are timely. It is unfortunate that a universal public distribution system (PDS) as recommended by the National Commission on Farmers has not been introduced in the place of the targeted PDS, which is riddled with corruption.


India has the largest number of malnourished children, women and men in the world and it is high time that Mahatma Gandhi’s suggestion “To a people famishing and idle, the only acceptable form in which God can dare appear is work and promise of food as wages"" is adopted.

The idea of reforming the fertilizer distribution system is good, and it will be better that the large subsidies given to fertilizer companies are directly provided to farmers through smart cards, so that they can buy the needed macro and micro nutrients based on soil health cards. Soil health enhancement is the pathway to higher productivity.

I am glad the Pulses Mission started during Rajiv Gandhi’s period is going to be revitalized. The single important cause for stagnation in the production of pulses is not the absence of seeds, but the lack of a remunerative marketing system at the field level in dry-farming areas. When remunerative and assured marketing is introduced, we can see faster progress in the production of both pulses and oilseeds. The milk revolution cited in the Economic Survey has many lessons for extrapolation to pulses, oilseeds and millets.


The finance minister has aptly quoted Jawaharlal Nehru’s famous statement made in 1947: “Everything else can wait but not agriculture"". Unfortunately it appears that agriculture not having to wait is an idea whose time is yet to come.","The Economic Survey and the UPA government's mid-term report highlight achievements over the past three years but admit to distress in the farm sector. With the agriculture sector facing challenges, the budget lacks a comprehensive strategy for agricultural renewal. While funds are allocated for irrigation expansion and additional credit for farmers, there is a need for more efficient water use. The proposal for restoring water bodies and groundwater recharge is welcomed, but a broader movement, similar to the Green Revolution, is needed. The extension system's revitalization is crucial, and reforms in fertilizer distribution and remunerative marketing for pulses are recommended. The budget could do more to address India's malnutrition challenges and improve the agriculture sector comprehensively."

Just before midnight on Thursday, Indian Space Research Organisation's first mission of 2019 will put into space a 740-kg military imaging satellite, Microsat-R.
 
ISRO has shied away from sharing details of the spacecraft or its uses as it does routinely each time during its missions; except to say the satellite would be placed within 15 minutes after take-off in a polar orbit 274 km away from Earth.

This is much lower than any of its civil Earth observation spacecraft, which fly pole to pole over the globe at between 400 km and 700 km.

According to information obtained from different sources Microsat-R and its payload come assembled from a handful of laboratories of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and is meant for military use. The satellite was “assembled outside and ISRO only interfaced it” with its own systems and the launch vehicle, just as it treats any customer satellite.

C-44 will be launched around 11.30 p.m. from the older First Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota.

For its part, ISRO is experimenting on two aspects of the vehicle. One is to reuse a waste stage. “For us, the excitement is about reusing the spent fourth stage [PS4] of the rocket as an orbiting platform for future experiments,” an official said. Kalamsat, a small student payload, will be the first to use PS4 as an orbital platform.

Amid the 28-hour countdown for the launch, ISRO Chairman K.Sivan said the PS4-Kalamsat experiment would be short-lived. It would start about 1.5 hours from take-off and last about 14 hours until Friday midday. Later experiments with PS4 will be improved gradually, he said.

For the third time in ISRO’s recent history, the mission team is slated to cut off and restart the PS4 engine twice over a flight lasting around 100 minutes.

ISRO’s pre-launch brochure said, “In PSLV-C44, the fourth stage (PS4) of the vehicle will be moved to higher circular orbit so as to establish an orbital platform for carrying out experiments.”

The other experiment with the launcher PSLV-C44 vehicle will be a new third variant having two strap-on boosters. Called the PSLV-DL, D standing for demonstration, it ranges between the older two variants.","ISRO's first mission of 2019, PSLV-C44, will launch the 740-kg military satellite Microsat-R into a low polar orbit.

He said this while speaking to reporters after releasing the BJP manifesto in Aizawl.
Thousands of people from Myanmar have taken refuge in various Northeastern states, especially in Mizoram, after fleeing their country following a military coup in February 2021.
“I think the security of our country, security of our states, including Mizoram, require us to take certain precautions. But the precautions that we are taking right now are in response to a certain situation. Even right now our neighbour is going through a very difficult phase. If things were normal in Myanmar, this would not have happened,” Jaishankar said.
He said that the Centre is very sensitive to the interests of people, traditions, customs and relationships across the border.
“Right now it is important that we take that precaution. So we want people to understand that this is a response to a situation today,” he said while talking about the proposed border fencing and abolition of the FMR.
The Centre in February decided to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and abolish the FMR between the two countries.
The FMR allows people residing close to the India-Myanmar border to venture 16 kms into each other’s territory without visa.
India shares a 1,643-km-long border with Myanmar and Mizoram, in particular, shares a 510-km border with the neighbouring country.
The Mizoram government, civil society organisations and student bodies have strongly opposed the Centre’s decision to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and lift the FMR because they believe that it will “disturb close contact between ethnic communities of the two countries.”
The Mizos share ethnic ties with the Chins.
The Mizoram assembly had on 28 February passed a resolution opposing the Centre’s decision to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and abolish the FMR.
Earlier, Chief Minister Lalduhoma had said that his government has strongly opposed the idea of fencing the international border and scrapping the FMR but the Mizoram government has no authority to oppose the Centre if it goes ahead with its plan","The Indian government, led by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, announced plans to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and abolish the free movement regime (FMR) in response to security concerns, particularly in light of the political instability in Myanmar. Thousands of refugees from Myanmar, especially in Mizoram, have sought refuge in India following the military coup in February 2021. The decision has faced opposition from the Mizoram government, civil society, and student bodies, who argue that it could disrupt the close ties between ethnic communities along the border. Despite objections, the Centre intends to proceed with the plan, emphasizing the need for precautionary measures to safeguard national security interests. The Mizoram assembly passed a resolution opposing the decision, although Chief Minister Lalduhoma acknowledged the state government's limited authority in opposing the Centre's directives. "

The Jharkhand-based players alleged that since their coach had political connections, they could not take the risk of filing a complaint against him in their home state.
The girls came down to Delhi, where they approached the Delhi Commission For Women, who helped them file the complaint at Kamla Market police station. “The girls approached us with their complaint and we helped them file a police complaint.

A fast-track court on Tuesday convicted four men of gang-raping and killing a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern on a moving bus in Delhi on December 16 last year, a case that caused nationwide outrage and led the government to bring in stringent anti-rape laws.

The quantum of sentence will be announced on Wednesday. The murder charge, for which the four men have been convicted, entails a maximum of death penalty and life term as the minimum punishment. All four had pleaded not guilty.

Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna found Mukesh, Pawan Gupta alias Kaalu, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Kumar alias Thakur guilty under 11 sections of the IPC, including gang rape, unnatural offences, murder (of the girl), attempt to murder (of the girl’s male friend), abduction, dacoity and causing the disappearance of evidence. He accused the men of cold-bloodedly killing their ""helpless victim"".

With tears in her eyes and wearing a pink sari, the mother of the victim sat just a few feet from the four men, who stood against a wall in the crowded courtroom as Khanna read out the verdict. ""I convict all of the accused. They have been found guilty of gang rape, unnatural offences, destruction of evidence... and for committing the murder of the helpless victim,"" he said.

As soon as the verdict was delivered, Pawan broke down while Vinay was in a state of shock. Mukesh was heard saying ""that they would have to face the consequences for what they have done"". The fourth convict Akshay seemed unaffected. The verdict capped a seven-month trial that was punctuated dramatically by the main accused Ram Singh, who is Mukesh’s brother, found hanging in his cell in Tihar Jail in March. The sixth accused, who is a juvenile and cannot be named as per the law, was on August 31 sent by the Juvenile Justice Board to a reform home for three years after it concluded that he was involved in rape and murder. The police said in the chargesheet the juvenile was the most brutal of the accused.

The defence counsel said they would appeal against the judgment in a higher court. “Although we respect the judgment, we are not happy with it. We will challenge it in the Delhi HC,” said Pawan’s lawyer, Sadashiv Gupta. Regarding the victim’s gangrape, Khanna said in his 237-page judgment, “If the accused had participated in the incident, then the question as to who committed the rape or who could not complete the act of rape becomes irrelevant for the conviction of gangrape. Hence, all accused are convicted under Section 376 (2) G (gang rape).”

The judgment also said the acts were done in a premeditated manner. “The nature of these acts suggests that none of them were impulsive. The act of the insertion of the rods (into the girl’s body) and the pulling out of internal organs after committing gang rape can in no manner be seen as an act done only to facilitate the commission of gang rape. Rather, this aspect makes the act of pulling out the internal organs of the prosecutrix to kill her, an intentional one… The act of moving the bus in a manner so that the victim comes under its wheels makes the acts of these accused as done with the intention of certainly resulting in her death,” read the judgment.

The verdict also mentioned that the rods inserted into the girl’s body caused 18 internal injuries to her organs. “They did this repeatedly and pulled out her internal organs even with their hands,” it said.

Mukesh’s lawyer, VK Anand said Mukesh was driving the bus at the time of the incident and was not involved. The judgment, however, said Mukesh’s argument he was only driving the bus makes him equally responsible in the crime. “He cannot escape his guilt by saying he was only driving the bus, while the others were brutally beating up the victims, committing unnatural sex and gangrape,” it said.

AP Singh, the lawyer representing Vinay and Akshay, told reporters outside the court that Vinay was at a musical programme at a district park when the incident took place. He also claimed Akshay was not in Delhi and had caught a train to Aurangabad on December 15, a day before the crime.

The verdict said the identity and presence of all the accused inside the bus at the time of the incident has been confirmed by DNA samples and scientific evidence.","

**New Delhi, September 10** – A fast-track court convicted four men for the brutal gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern on a moving bus in Delhi on December 16 last year—a case that sparked nationwide outrage and led to stricter anti-rape laws.

The four convicted men—Mukesh, Pawan Gupta (alias Kaalu), Vinay Sharma, and Akshay Kumar (alias Thakur)—were found guilty under 11 IPC sections including gang rape, murder, attempt to murder, abduction, dacoity, unnatural offences, and destruction of evidence. The quantum of sentence was to be announced the next day.

Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna described the crime as a cold-blooded killing of a helpless victim. The mother of the victim was present in the courtroom during the verdict.

The trial lasted seven months and was marked by the death of a main accused, Ram Singh (Mukesh’s brother), who was found hanging in jail. The juvenile accused was sentenced to three years in a reform home. The judgment highlighted that the acts were premeditated, describing horrific details such as rods being inserted causing 18 internal injuries and the pulling out of internal organs, done intentionally to kill the victim.

The court rejected Mukesh’s defense that he was only driving the bus, holding him equally responsible. Claims by Vinay and Akshay’s lawyers that their clients were elsewhere were dismissed due to DNA and scientific evidence confirming all accused were present on the bus.

Defense lawyers announced plans to appeal the verdict in the Delhi High Court.

2ef43cb99eb7a1129ceea2e619591b14,"[DOC 1] The Lok Sabha tonight cleared the National Food Security Bill with near-unanimity amid Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s call for wiping out hunger and malnutrition from the country.
The Bill provides for food subsidy to two-thirds of the population and cost the exchequer Rs 1.24 lakh crore during the current fiscal. It will now go to the Rajya Sabha for final ratification before the President gives his ascent.

Earlier, Sonia sought to allay concerns over the measure. “This legislation is only a beginning. As we move forward, we will be open to constructive suggestions; we will learn from experience.”

The ambitious Bill was adopted by the House through a voice vote at 10.45 pm after an 11-hour non-stop discussion on the measure and a statutory resolution seeking to disapprove the ordinance promulgated on July 5. Over 300 amendments moved by the Opposition were rejected.

Touted as an election “game-changer”, the Bill will enable crores of eligible families to get rice at Rs 3 per kg and wheat at Rs 2 per kg.

The Bill provides immunity against whimsical political masters, as it provides for food security allowance to the beneficiaries if the foodgrain is not supplied to them.

The BJP-led Opposition, which called the Bill a “vote security” programme, was clearly opposed to the clause. Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj, who was unhappy at the rejection of amendments proposed by her party, said: “We support this half-baked Bill and will amend it further when we come to power.” Swaraj’s amendment seeking a ban on cash transfers in lieu of foodgrain was negated by the House in a vote.

A special focus has been put on nutritional support to women and children in the Bill. Women will get a Rs 6,000 maternity allowance besides nutritional food. Children in the age group of six months to 14 years will be entitled to take home ration or hot cooked food under the prescribed nutritional norms.

The original Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 22, 2011 to addresses the issue of food security. It was referred to a Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution, which interacted with other Central ministries, organisations and individuals, and visited states before submitting its report to the Speaker on January 17.","The Lok Sabha passed the National Food Security Bill, aiming to subsidize food for two-thirds of India’s population at an estimated cost of ₹1.24 lakh crore. Despite opposition and 300 rejected amendments, the bill promises affordable grains, nutritional support to women and children, and a food security allowance for supply failures.

As opposed to the safe, anodyne headlines of English newspapers, which for the most part are sober, balanced and responsible, the Hindi papers are, generally speaking, more triumphalist in their interpretation and presentation.

Only The Telegraph, Calcutta, goes out of its way to editorialise the Supreme Court judgment, but the front pages of most English newspapers, on the whole, underline the “disconnect” between so-called “liberal” and “conservative” media, a division the BJP exploited to the hilt before it succeeded in appropriating that space too.

 Adding a new dimension to jungle safari in Maharashtra to attract more tourists, the Forest Department is set to start jungle safari on boat in Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) from November this year. Maharashtra, which has second highest population of tigers in the country, is getting serious to develop eco-tourism by introducing new ideas in its reserve forests. PTR is set to become the Central India’s firsttiger reserve to have the facility of jungle safari on boat. Maharashtra Forest Department allows jungle safari on Maruti Gypsy, Mahindra Bolero and Tata buses in all its tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. Trained elephants are in use at some of the tiger reserves including Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) and Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) for jungle safari. Addition of four more tuskers from Karnataka will boost jungle safari on elephants in PTR. Now, tourists can enjoy jungle safari on the boat too. “We had sent the proposal for jungle safari on boat to the Government last year. It was a Rs 2.90 crore proposal which immediately got the approval from the Government. The tendering process for the same will be approved by the State Government soon,” Dr Prabhu Nath Shukla, Field Director, PTR, told ‘The Hitavada’.
  
 “Initially, we will start the jungle safari on two boats. On getting good response from wildlife lovers, we will increase the number of boats,” said Dr Shukla. Through ‘Jungle Safari on Boat’, wildlife lovers and tourists will have a unique adventure apart from sighting wild animals coming to the banks of Pench river to quench thirst. Tourists can have a thrilling experience in Pench river which has a good number of crocodiles. Also, a better view of thousands of migratory birds visiting PTR from a long distance will be a new experience for the tourists. “This form of jungle safari will allow tourists to enjoy sighting wild animals, know more about aquatic life of Pench river and also the birds which are rare to sight during jungle safari by road or on elephants,” said Dr Shukla.
  
 Tourists can travel 23 kilometers on boat during the safari which will be held between Kolitmara and Navegaon Khairi. The safari of boat will be held for two-and-a-half hours. The Department is currently conducting trials of jungle safari on boat. A review in this regard is being conducted by the Forest Department. According to the sources, the jungle safari of boat is likely to start in the month of November this year. Using boats will not disturb peace in the jungle as special solar boats will be used to avoid noise, air and water pollution. The charges for the jungle safari on boat will be around Rs 1,500 per person and the boat can accommodate 24 persons at a time.","The Maharashtra Forest Department is set to introduce a novel dimension to jungle safaris in the state by launching boat safaris in the Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) starting from November this year.

In a clear rebuff to his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, who had on Friday insisted on a plebiscite in Kashmir, Modi said, “raising issues in this forum is not the way to make progress towards resolving issues between our two countries"".

In his maiden address to the 193-member UN General Assembly, the Prime Minister did not directly refer to Sharif who had attacked India on Kashmir in his speech to the forum on Friday, but asserted that Pakistan must take its responsibility seriously to create an appropriate environment for a bilateral dialogue to promote friendship and cooperation.

The Indian leader underlined that his government placed the highest priority on advancing friendship and cooperation with its neighbours, including Pakistan.

Speaking in Hindi, Modi said, “I am prepared to engage in a serious bilateral dialogue with Pakistan in a peaceful atmosphere, without the shadow of terrorism, to promote our friendship and cooperation.""

He also made references to the rise of terrorism in various parts of the world where it was “taking new shape and new name"" and said that no country big or small was free from its threat.

Without naming Pakistan, the prime minister said even today “states allow terrorist sanctuaries on their territory or use terrorism as instruments of their policy"".

Asking the world to rise above politics, divisions, discrimination and distinction between good and bad terrorists, Modi called for adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism by the United Nations. “This is a time of great flux and change. The world is witnessing tensions and turmoil on a scale rarely seen in recent history,"" Modi said in his maiden address to the UN General Assembly.

He welcomed efforts to combat terrorism’s resurgence in West Asia, which is affecting countries near and far.

Modi said an integrating Asia Pacific region is still concerned about maritime security that is fundamental to its future. Europe faces risk of new division, he stressed, adding that in West Asia, extremism and fault lines are growing. “Our own region continues to face the destabilizing threat of terrorism. Africa faces the twin threat of rising terrorism and a health crisis,"" he said.

The effort should involve the support of all countries in the region, he said, adding that the UN should ensure that there will be peace, stability and order in the outer space and cyber space. “We should work together to ensure that all countries observe international rules and norms,"" he said.

Known for his flair for catchy punchlines, Modi coined a new term “G-All"" during his 35-minutes speech.

Modi mooted this while pointing towards the need for the world to become more united as nations, saying no one country or group of countries can determine the course of this world.

“Today, we still operate in various Gs with different numbers. India, too, is involved in several. But, how much are we able to work together as G-1 or G-All?,"" he said while calling for uniting various groupings for concerted efforts to deal with various key challenges.

“While we speak of an interdependent world, have we become more united as nations?,"" he asked. Modi said the names of groupings keep changing like G-5, G-20 and so on but there was a need to have a G-All to realize various goals and improve lives of people across the world. “On the one side, we say that our destinies are inter- linked, on the other hand we still think in terms of zero sum game. If the other benefits, I stand to lose,"" the Prime Minister said.

“It is easy to be cynical and say nothing will change; but if we do that, we run the risk of shirking our responsibilities and we put our collective future in danger,"" he said. Modi said there has to be a genuine international partnership. “This is not just a moral position, but a practical reality.""

Even as the Prime Minister arrived for his first address to the General Assembly on Saturday, a large number of Indian-Americans gathered outside the UN headquarters to welcome him. The crowd, comprising almost equal number of men and women, carried placards with messages like “New York loves Modi"", “America loves Modi"" and chanted “Modi Modi"" slogans.

People were seen wearing Modi t-shirts and masks, similar to the scenes that were there during Lok Sabha elections back in India earlier this year.

Modi also met UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the UN headquarters in New York before addressing the General Assembly.

Initial reports suggest that at least 11 people are feared dead in the horrific incident, though only two bodies have been recovered so far.

The vehicle, reportedly carrying 17 members of the same family, was completely submerged in the fast-flowing Alaknanda, making rescue operations extremely challenging due to the strong currents, officials from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) said.

SDRF divers, along with police and district administration teams, have launched extensive relief and rescue operations to retrieve the missing and those feared trapped.

SDRF Commandant Arpan Yaduvanshi confirmed the details to TNIE, “Around 7:30 am on Thursday, near Ghoolteer on the Rishikesh–Badrinath Highway in Rudraprayag district, a Tempo Traveller lost control and plunged directly into the Alaknanda River.

All 17 occupants of the vehicle were from the same family, hailing from Udaipur, Rajasthan, and were on a pilgrimage. Upon receiving news of the accident, teams from the police, SDRF, and district administration swiftly arrived at the scene and launched a rescue operation with the assistance of divers.”
Providing an update on the casualties, District Disaster Management Officer Nandan Singh Rajwar told this newspaper, “As of now, nine individuals have been rescued, two of whom have unfortunately succumbed to their injuries. One of the deceased is a woman. Eight injured individuals have been rushed to the district hospital; several young children are among the injured.”

Eyewitnesses recounted the harrowing moments, stating that three individuals were flung out of the vehicle upon impact and were immediately rushed to the hospital in critical condition.The fate of the remaining passengers remains uncertain, with fears that many were swept away by the river’s treacherous currents.

In a grim discovery, one body was found approximately 8 kilometres downstream at Shivpuri, underlining the force of the river.

fc6f79dd96bd7475ab93e5499a3032b6,"[DOC 1] Vishal Malkan, malkansview.com, says the market has made a strong bottom at around 22,000 in the last couple of days. The market has tried that bottom three times and bounced back. Till election results throw up a very clear majority, the market is going to be in the 22,000-23,000 range. But stock specific and sector specific, there are some great ideas which Malkan is going for including Tata Power, Sun Pharma and Glenmark.

Is a firm bottom in place in your view or is the 21,800 window still open to go there?
Vishal Malkan: We have a strong bottom at around 22,000 which we saw in the last couple of days and invariably it is taking support in the last almost like three months. We have tried that bottom three times and bounced back. Till we get a very clear majority, we are going to be in this range of 22,000-23,000, which is a broad range. But stock specific and sector specific, there are great ideas which are performing nowadays and I would go with that.

What are your best picks in this kind of a setup? Where would you like to bet on?
Vishal Malkan: Some of the stocks which are fitting into my favourite strategy right now are Tata Power which is taking great support around 400, 420 levels and it is overall into a strong momentum trend on the monthly chart but on the daily chart when you see a retracement or a correction, you tend to buy at support which is a great support around 410 and 415 so that is my first pick.

Similarly, the same strategy I would like for Sun Pharma and Glenmark – both pharma companies and both taking support at important levels. Sun Pharma around 1500 and Glenmark around 990 to 1000 is a great support, both can move up 4% to 5% from here on short trading calls for the next few weeks.

The other space which has been holding out today is the metals basket. What is your view on autos? Any name that stands out within that basket?
Vishal Malkan: One auto stock in particular has consolidated a lot in six-eight months and now has broken out above that level of 190. It is Ashok Leyland. That is going to be my favourite for the next couple of months because that is an all-time cup pattern and consolidation breakout. Above 200 it is a very good stock and we look at 225 to 230 in the maybe next couple of expiries.


What about UPL, would you be a buyer at this dip?
Vishal Malkan: It has been a good consolidation stock in the last four months and given a good move in the last three-four days, today's move is like a downward pressure, but it does not have that much volume. So, I suppose that around 490 to 500 is a good support and definitely it can be taken as a buy on dip right now.

Can you do a chart check for us on Hindalco?
Vishal Malkan: Yes, like all metals are buzzing in the last few days. Hindalco is also poised for a good move. There is a very strong support around 610-615 which was a resistance earlier, now it has become a support. So, with that stop loss, I can definitely go long for targets of 690 and 700 plus.","Vishal Malkan emphasized a strong market bottom at around 22,000, indicating support in the 22,000-23,000 range until clear election results. His top stock picks include Tata Power, Sun Pharma, and Glenmark due to solid support levels. Ashok Leyland stands out in autos, while UPL and Hindalco show potential for positive moves.  "

3dc9322390fa90ac55cef708ca2f356c,"[DOC 1] Women are now being preferred at workplaces

Gone are the days when women were restricted only to their homes. Today’s women are not just educated, but well-empowered as well. They are seen almost in all kinds of profession and give a tough competition to men. What’s more? According to recent studies, we also hear that women are preferred more at workplaces.


ara

Anil Warrier, director of India Staffing, a research and development company, states the reasons. “One of the major reasons why women weren’t preferred at workplaces earlier is for maternity breaks. Earlier, most of them rescued to the option of resigning or opt for long breaks. However, the scenario has changed now with companies offering them the option to work from home. Even issues like working late nights have been modified according to an individual’s convenience. All the problems have been given a flexible solution that this issue doesn’t seem to appear larger anymore,” he says.

He also says that women make better managers than men. He says, “I think they make better managers than men. They have the ability to multi-task and know how to keep the team together. I think today’s women are more creative and have varied solutions to handle a crisis.” Agrees entrepreneur Namrata Kini Radhakrishnan, “Women have people skills and that’s one of the reasons why they are preferred more at workplaces. To handle a team full of people who come from various backgrounds takes a skill to handle them. I am sure women can do it better than men. Their emotional quotient is also better than men, which is why I think they are preferred more at workplaces today.”
The gender divide:

There have been times when men didn’t like to work under women bosses. Nevertheless, Priya Chetty-Rajagopal, vice-president and partner at an executive research company says that gender issues don’t matter in today’s world. “People don’t really think if they are working under a male or a female boss these days. They don’t compare on basis of gender, but on basis of work approach. People have accepted different temperaments men and women work with and such things don’t matter today. As a matter of fact, such issues might just become redundant in the next couple of years,” she explains.
Anil also informs that Gen Y women are more competitive and aggressive when it comes to work. “The Gen Y girls are much more strong and aggressive. Their attitude towards work is completely different. They not only work hard, but also come up with ideas that are exceptional. I think the notion to work under women bosses have faded and died,” he says. Namrata adds, “Such tags don’t even enter a man’s radar today. I think it’s all about who is performing at their workplace today.”","In contemporary workplaces, women are increasingly preferred due to their enhanced empowerment and skills, challenging traditional gender roles. Maternity policies have evolved, allowing women to work from home and offering flexible schedules, reducing past concerns about breaks. According to Anil Warrier and Namrata Kini Radhakrishnan, women excel as managers, demonstrating superior multitasking abilities and emotional intelligence. Priya Chetty-Rajagopal notes that gender dynamics are less relevant today, with focus shifting to work approach rather than gender. The rising competitiveness and assertiveness of Generation Y women further diminishes old biases against female leadership. Overall, workplaces are embracing women for their diverse skills and leadership qualities, foreseeing a future where gender distinctions in professional settings may become obsolete."

ALLAHABAD: Why do wesleepand why is sleep so important for us? Through ages, the curiosity and the mystery associated with it still baffle many.Neurologist Pankaj Gupta said that sleep is the biggest casualty of the urban way of living. Everyday as an urbanite rushes for work, shopping, socialising not to mention the necessary evils of TV-computer-mobile, he/she finds himself/herself cutting or pruning the sleep time as never before.""Without realising the harm we are doing to our mental and physical health or to the error of judgment, we are more prone to the aberrant behaviour its link with chronic sleep deprivation,"" he said. The urban population looks upon sleep as a passive act when irresistible mantras like `shop till you drop' and `work hard and party even harder' are the new buzz word.Little does the unsuspecting denizen realise that an epidemic of insomnia and host of medical conditions are afflicting the adult population. Sleep scavenges the dust accumulated during day time in our brains as neurons work hard during sleep to repair the day time wear and tear, he added. Memory codes are formed during sleep, which lays the foundation for long-term memory.Sleep prepares our brains for working normally the next day or act like an anti-virus software which mops the virus for its proper functioning, he said.Inadequate sleep could make us irritable, irrational and clumsy. Our concentration, judgment, memory and hand-eye coordination gets affected.Chronic sleep deprivation causes us to have `micro sleeps' during daytime. These are small periods during the day when our mind gets shut off though our eyes maybe open and we may look awake. Micro sleeps are the cause of twenty per cent road accidents. Prolonged deprivation of sleep decreases our immunity and makes us prone to infection and increases our weight.Talking about day-time sleepiness, Gupta said that this may be a symptom of some serious ailment. If somebody talks of increased sleepiness, we think that the person is less motivated and sloppy rather than thinking it to be a symptom of a disease.Millions of people world over may have to work during night like those of industry workers, peoples working in transport industry, policing, doctors etc and these people suffer from rhythm sleep disorders. Since such people feel groggy during their work time and awake during their sleep time, this sleep disturbance nearly doubles the risk of a fatal work accident. Higher rates of cancer, cardiac diseases, gastro-intestinal and reproductive disorders are seen in night shift workers.We are born to sleep for a pre-decided number of hours. If we sleep less than that, then the deficit will give us micro sleeps or make us sleep more during Sundays or other holidays, Gupta added.","Sleep prepares brain to function normally

His wisdom! Kabir says the most profound things but in a simple manner. He reminds us that the wisdom is within all of us because we come from the same source. The whole point of life is to reconnect with that source. Our mind keeps us disconnected from the deepest parts of ourselves and from each other because we get carried away by the superficial way in which the world functions. Kabir questions things, and he urges us to do the same. Each poem of his is like a wake-up call, or a gentle and loving knock on the head.

The fact that he lived a few centuries ago does not matter. Human nature remains the same. For example, let's take this doha (couplet) that I really like: Dheere dheere re mana, dheere sab kuchh hoye/ Maali seenche sau ghada, ritu aave phal hoye. Kabir is asking us to let things be. He is talking about the virtue of patience that we keep forgetting. We are always trying to be smarter, bigger, and faster than nature instead of living in harmony with it.

His poetry has many shades to it apart from the devotional aspect. It is philosophical, social, spiritual and political. Kabir knows how to convey a strong message without being hurtful.

What was your thought process behind Electro Kabira, the set that the Vasu Dixit Collective presented at the Mahindra Kabira Festival?

I have been listening to Kabir for a while now but the invitation to perform at the Mahindra Kabira Festival gave me the space and opportunity see how Kabir's words could be presented in a new way. My approach was to move away from the conventional band sound and give it a more folksy, electronic and acoustic touch. I have been exploring this for a little more than a year now but it has taken its own time to evolve. I am lucky to have collaborators like Manu Shrivastava and Joel Sakkari. Manu is great with arrangements. He plays the synth keyboard and the melodica. Joel plays the synth keyboard, synth bass and guitar. He is a learned production engineer, and he is great with mixing. We enjoy jamming as a collective.

To be honest, I was a bit sceptical about the kind of response we might get because Kabir's words are still being sung today in traditional formats. I was not sure if people would accept our way of exploring and interpreting Kabir. Bands like Indian Ocean and Kabir Cafe have found acceptance when they have tried out new things, so that gave us the courage to share our take on Kabir. It was important for us to be sensitive to the words, and not drown them out with the electronic sounds. We had to be conscious about striking a balance so that we would not alienate the audience even as we wanted to give them a taste of something new.

Tell us a bit about the context in which you learnt the Kabir bhajans you sang at the Mahindra Kabira Festival, and what they mean to you personally.

I learnt Sunta Hai Guru Gyani by listening to Kumar Gandharva, by falling in love with how he just becomes the song. It puts me in a difference mind space. I picked up Thaara Rang Mahal Mein from Prahlad Singh Tipanya, Vaari Jaaun Re from Mooralala Marwada and Naiharva from my wife Bindhumalini Narayanaswamy. I heard Shabnam Virmani singing Mann Mast Hua Phir Kya Bole many years ago at an amphitheatre in Bangalore, and I loved it the minute I heard it because of the meaning. What is there to say when your heart is intoxicated with bliss? O Sadho is a compilation of different dohas.

How has Electro Kabira been received by folk musicians who sing Kabir?

When I shared a couple of our songs with a folk singer friend, he was taken aback. Electro Kabira is perhaps too much of a departure from the traditional manner in which Kabir is performed. Whether we have failed or been welcomed with open arms is for the audience to say. I have a lot of gratitude for traditional forms, and I draw inspiration from them. But as a musician, I feel the need to explore and experiment. This means that I have to be true to my journey, and cannot make everyone happy. I hope that the Vasu Dixit Collective can introduce Kabir to new ears. His words can make them look at life from a new perspective.

For me, singing Kabir is not just about singing a set of lyrics. It is a personal encounter. His words have sunk in deep. A few months ago, when I had a ligament tear and a knee surgery, I had to stay home and recover. It was a low period, emotionally speaking. There was a lot of introspection and questioning, so much sadness and sorrow to reflect on. I learnt to meditate and be with myself. I also joined a philosophy course to understand my inner world better. In some ways, Kabir brings all these strands together. The images and metaphors that he uses are so powerful. The body, for example, is compared to a pot that is going to break one day.

How did being in Varanasi add to your appreciation of Kabir?

Knowing that we were at the place where Kabir came from, knowing that the river Ganga and the people living on its banks had inspired his poetry, was very inspiring for us as musicians. I thought about what the place must have meant to Kabir himself. His poems speak a lot about death, and that makes sense because Varanasi is a city that is synonymous with death for many people. My mother passed away last year, and being in Varanasi also helped me let go of some of the things that I had been holding on to. The city teaches you that your life is not permanent, so you have to let some things be and let some things go.

What challenges did you encounter with the language of the poetry?

It was not very easy to understand on my own, so I referred to translations that are available online and in books. It was helpful to know what scholars have written and how poems have been interpreted. But it was equally important to develop my own interpretation.

What are some of the similarities and differences that you notice across Kabir, Basavanna and Purandaradasa - the three saint poets that you sang?

All of them talk about consciousness, the soul, oneness, and being centred. Kabir and Basavanna spoke against the caste system. Basavanna uses a lot of dark humour. Kabir can be direct but gentle. Purandaradasa is purely devotional. Singing their words pushes me to bring their wisdom into my everyday life. Singing them only for applause is not enough. I am glad that the festival gave me a chance to present songs in Hindi as well as Kannada.

How do you distinguish between the work that you do for Swarathma and the Vasu Dixit Collective? Why does it feel important to maintain separate identities?

With Swarathma, we write our own songs. We do not sing the work of saint poets. The Vasu Dixit Collective fulfils my need to break out of the typical band set-up and also immerse in the world of saint poets that I was introduced to way back in my childhood. A visible demarcation between the two bands makes things clear for us and for the listeners.

Tell us about your PaDa project, which focuses on documenting folk music.

The perception that folk music is dying out was worrying for me, so I wanted to document young folk music practitioners from various parts of India. We recorded their songs in their own homes and villages across five states - Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur and Meghalaya. All five episodes are available on my YouTube channel. Believe India, an online music distribution company, funded it along with Snehadhara Foundation.

The PaDa project gave me a chance to absorb new things, see new places and put the filmmaking skills that I learnt at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad to some good use. It gets its name from ""Pada"", which means a word, lyric or verse in folk music. The name is also a play on ""Pa"" and ""Da"", which are important notes in Indian classical music. Since we were recording people's own settings, the sounds of birds and animals beautifully merged with their music. We had to bring the footage to the studio, add some elements, and edit it into episodes. It was an exciting creative process, and also a way of showing my gratitude to folk music because that's where my inspiration to be a musician comes from.

Folk music cannot be reduced to either art or entertainment. It is a part of everyday life and culture. It is passed from one generation to the next. It gives a sense of belonging. It expresses philosophical truths through story and poetry. It has a simplicity that allows everyone to participate. It makes us open our hearts, and connect with the larger community.

e984e75d0fb860bcfbe86287e3d91d51,"[DOC 1] New Delhi: Real estate companies face a double whammy following the lockdown. Not only did work come to a halt, builders will now have to pay a higher rate of goods and services tax if they haven’t bought at least 80% of the construction material from registered dealers.

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has mandated the payment of 18% GST if procurement of materials from registered dealers falls short of the threshold. CBIC field offices have been asked to inform the trade that the tax for the financial year ended March must be paid before June 30. The requisite forms have been issued as well.

“CBIC has cleared its stand that there will be no Covid extension for any taxpayer in the real estate sector for tax payments due to procurements from unregistered persons below an 80% threshold,” said Rajat Mohan, senior partner at AMRG Associates.

The real estate sector has been among the hardest hit after the Covid-19 outbreak in India as the two-month lockdown blocked the supply of construction material and millions of workers travelled to their villages, leaving many construction projects at a standstill.

With the massive reduction in demand, realtors are certain they will not meet the norm of buying at least 80% of the construction material from registered dealers.

The rate of 18% GST on shortfall of procurement from registered dealers was decided by the GST Council in March 2019 while offering the real estate sector revised rates of 1% GST for construction of affordable residential apartments and 5% GST for other residential apartments, without input tax credit.

“This tax shall be paid through a prescribed form electronically on the common portal by end of the quarter following the financial year. Accordingly, for FY 2019-20, tax on such shortfall is to be paid by the 30th June, 2020,” the CBIC said in its instructions issued last week.

Experts said that while the decision was taken last year, the absence of requisite forms led to the assumption that the government would provide some relief in making the payments, in addition to other measures already announced, especially on account of Covid-19.

The industry has demanded GST waiver for the residential segment, besides a one-time stamp duty waiver, but these demands have not been met so far.","Real estate companies in India are facing challenges as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. Builders who haven't purchased at least 80% of construction material from registered dealers are now required to pay a higher rate of goods and services tax (GST). The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has mandated the payment of 18% GST if the procurement of materials from registered dealers falls short of the 80% threshold. This adds another burden to the real estate sector, which has been severely impacted by the lockdown, blocking the supply of construction material and leaving many projects at a standstill."

With mobile phones being increasingly used for transactions, instances have been reported of fraudsters intercepting one-time passwords by obtaining duplicate SIM cards. The ATMs need to be highly secured as cardholders are ignorant about such tricks.
The problem of ATM frauds is global in nature and its ramifications have been felt in India as well. It not only causes financial loss to banks but they also undermine customers’ confidence in the use of ATMs. It is one of the most common types of fraud but there are some measures that people who own credit cards and debit cards can take to avoid theft of their identity.
Criminals are scoring top marks for their devious ways. Statistically, card skimming is now the preferred method of ATM fraud, though it’s not only limited to the ATM environment. Skimming was once solely limited to credit cards, but the reality is that it now also includes debit cards.
The ATM fraud is not the sole problem of banks alone. It is a big threat and it requires a coordinated and cooperative action on the part of the bank, customers and the law enforcement machinery. There is thus a need to take precautionary and insurance measures that give greater “protection” to the ATMs, particularly those located in less secure areas. It is high time to revoke the Cyber Law of India as soon as possible and enact Strong and Effective Laws in this regard.
Till we have suitable and apt laws, we must apply existing laws in a purposive and updating manner.","The surge in ATM frauds, including credit card, internet banking, and phishing scams, poses a significant threat to financial security in India. Fraudsters exploit vulnerabilities like intercepting OTPs via duplicate SIM cards. These crimes not only cause financial losses but also erode trust in ATM usage.

Urgent measures, including stronger legislation and enhanced security protocols, are imperative to combat the escalating threat of cyber fraud in the country."

The construction of the 340-km expressway is on in full swing after the suspension of civil works for a few weeks due to the lockdown.

Eight different packages of the infra projects are being developed by five private companies, namely, Gayatri Projects, PNC Infratech, GR Infra Project, Apco Infratech and Oriental Structural Engineering.

Chairing a review meeting in Lucknow, nodal agency, UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) Chief Executive Officer Awanish Kumar Awasthi, who is also Additional Chief Secretary, asked the developers to expedite the project and to actively absorb the migrants in civil works. He instructed these companies to promptly submit bills to UPEIDA so that payments could be released on time. Involving the acquisition of 4,332 hectares, the expressway will traverse nine districts viz. Lucknow, Barabanki, Faizabad, Ambedkarnagar, Amethi, Sultanpur, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur.

Purvanchal Expressway will provide seamless connectivity between the backward eastern UP districts to the National Capital Region (NCR) via the already operational Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Agra-Greater Noida Yamuna Expressway.

It will also have an emergency airstrip for Indian Air Force jets at Kurebhar (Sultanpur). Currently, Agra-Lucknow Expressway has a 3.3-km-long runway at Unnao for allowing landing and takeoff of IAF fighter planes during emergency.

Meanwhile, 48 per cent of the civil works of Purvanchal Expressway has been completed and UPEIDA is targeting 50 per cent of the work is completed by the end of June 2020.

Besides, the government is now pursuing another mega Ganga Expressway project for an early launch. The UPEIDA has recently estimated the civil work and land cost of the 628-km project at nearly Rs 21,000 crore and Rs 9,000 crore respectively, thus totalling Rs 30,000 crore.

Currently, three expressway projects totalling over Rs 42,000 crore are underway viz. 340 km Purvanchal Expressway, 296 km Bundelkhand Expressway and 91 km Gorakhpur Link Expressway, which are estimated to cost Rs 23,000 crore, Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 4,600 crore respectively.

The 16-lane Ganga Expressway will entail acquisition of 6,556 hectares of land and link 12 districts, including Meerut, Amroha, Bulandshahar, Budaun, Shahjahanpur, Farrukhabad, Hardoi, Kannauj, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh and Prayagraj districts. It will be divided into 12 different packages for simultaneous development by the concessionaires, who would be selected through a competitive bidding process like the other ongoing expressway projects.

With 2022 UP elections less than two years away, the Yogi Adityanath government is expediting all the expressway projects, since they are the most visible specimen of development in the hinterland and spur local economy along their course.","The Uttar Pradesh government has directed private developers of the Rs 23,000 crore Purvanchal Expressway to prioritize employment for returning migrant workers affected by lockdowns.

During one of Viduthalai Part 2’s best scenes, a brief and fleeting moment features a leaf falling on an unconscious Perumal Vaathiyaar (Vijay Sethupathi). It’s as if nature wants to wake him up to stop the proceeding act of injustice. When that does not work, nature amps it up with a dose of rain that awakens him, literally and figuratively. Moments like these populate Vetri Maaran’s Viduthalai Part 2, his most politically charged film yet that leaves you wishing it had more to offer.


The first Viduthalai film followed the journey of Constable Kumaresan (Soori), a newly recruited constable who had no choice but to get quickly acclimatised to the harsh conditions of his unit and the harsher treatment his peers mete out to the villagers safeguarding Vaathiyaar. Viduthalai Part 2 sidelines the story of the paltry cop and instead, focuses on the trials and tribulations of Vaathiyaar by showcasing the path — laden with blood, sweat and tears shed by him and his comrades — that turned this unassuming teacher into a leader. As the captured Vaathiyaar is ordered to be brought to a camp inconspicuously, Kumaresan, his depraved boss Ragavendar (Chetan) and the team have to brave treacherous terrain and Vaathiyaar in his ‘Oru kadha sollata saar?’ mode as they embark on a journey through the forest.

 ‘Viduthalai Part 1’ movie review: Soori shines in Vetri Maaran’s most politically-charged film yet

The first film, in establishing the two sides of the conflict, the politics behind them and the several issues plaguing both sides, presented facts without getting into the greys that separate them. It concentrated on the conflict between the troops and the group, as well as the life of Kumaresan who had to make the difficult trade of his innocence and morals for recognition in his job and the love he found in Tamizharasi (Bhavani Sre). The sequel though, using the past of Vaathiyaar as a tool, zooms in on how the system, put in place to protect its people, works against them and how those who stand against it are branded as militants.

Viduthalai Part 2 (Tamil)
Director: Vetri Maaran
Cast: Vijay Sethupathi, Manju Warrier, Soori, Chetan
Runtime: 170 minutes
Storyline: When an unassuming school teacher is pushed to the brink, he takes up arms in a fiery rebellion, transforming into a people’s leader
Viduthalai Part 2 firmly touches upon the inequality within people, the systemic oppression in place, the forces that keep solutions at bay, and the system that favours those in power. Like how Vaathiyaar schools cops on the difference between facts and information broken down into pieces and left to the listener to piece together, Viduthalai Part 2 packs enough to ignite a spark within those whose ideologies do not align with that of the film.

But there’s only so much ideas (or ideologies) can do and it would not be an overstatement to call the sequel a far cry from the comparatively well-rounded first film. Kumaresan, played by Soori, much like Vetri’s previous heroes, was an underdog unwittingly pulled into a world of chaos that he has to escape somehow. Amidst the pandemonium he was subjected to — thanks to the moral and ethical dilemmas within him — Kumaresan found solace in a fellow villager and rose to the occasion when she was harassed. Here too the trigger point for Vaathiyaar’s character is something similar, but the sequel suffocates beneath the weight of its preachiness.

 Soori on ‘Viduthalai’, the story behind its making, and his takeaway from a 25-year journey


If the first film narrated a story that unravelled in mere days, Viduthalai Part 2 captures the decades spent by its leading man who evolves as the film progresses. This, while adding flab to a film that already runs close to three hours, also dilutes the intensity of the punch it strives to strike.


Of course, Vijay Sethupathi is fantastic as Vaathiyaar, and with Maharaja, it’s lovely to see the ace performer back to playing lead roles showcasing his acting prowess.  Ken Karunas and Manju Warrier to make their presence felt and Chetan and Rajiv Menon as evil officials wreck more havoc than what they did in the first film. However, unlike Viduthalai Part 1, which treated most of its primary characters as mere pawns in a game played by those above, the sequel is a Vijay Sethupathi show all the way, leaving very little for the rest to do. Unsurprisingly, when emotions are shared or lives are mercilessly taken, Viduthalai Part 2 fails to recreate the impact its predecessor did.

 Chetan on ‘Viduthalai’: Vetri Maaran said he’ll call me for the right role after ‘Polladhavan’ and it has been worth the wait

At a time when filmmakers struggle to write strong villains, Viduthalai Part 2 sports an array of characters with different shades of evil. If Rajiv Menon’s character is bureaucratic evil, Chetan plays an egotistical maniac who’s ready to kill to save his pride. Vetri stuffs the film with a slew of such characters and there’s an attempt to add individuality if not an entire arc to these characters. We learn that Rajiv’s character supports people learning Hindi and another cop is happy to throw a fellow cop under the bus even though he’s his relative. There’s even a throwaway line on how Left-wing terminology originated from the French Revolution. These aspects add very little to the overarching plot that’s painfully wafer-thin. You begin to wonder if Viduthalai could have been a solo outing with each half of it showing how Kumaresan and Vaathiyaar are two sides of the same coin.

","Viduthalai Part 2, directed by Vetri Maaran, focuses on the evolution of Perumal Vaathiyaar (Vijay Sethupathi) from an unassuming teacher to a revolutionary leader, sidelining the earlier focus on Constable Kumaresan (Soori). The film delves into systemic oppression, inequality, and the forces that keep societal change at bay, portraying how those who stand against the system are branded as militants. A striking moment in the film shows nature itself—through a falling leaf and rain—attempting to awaken Vaathiyaar, symbolizing the emotional and political awakening of his character.

While the film is politically charged, exploring themes of injustice and the exploitation of marginalized communities, it suffers from a sense of preachiness and a diluted impact compared to the first film. The narrative, spanning decades, stretches the plot and dilutes its intensity, while shifting the focus heavily onto Vijay Sethupathi's performance, leaving little room for other characters. While the film features a range of evil characters, such as Chetan's egotistical antagonist and Rajiv Menon’s bureaucratic villain, these subplots feel underdeveloped and add little to the main story. Despite strong performances, particularly from Sethupathi, Viduthalai Part 2 lacks the emotional punch of its predecessor, becoming a far more ideologically-driven, but less compelling, narrative."

With the US lifting sanctions on Fiji this week, and the Commonwealth re-admitting it after their elections in September, the world's interest in Fiji has been rekindled. Frank Bainimarama and his party won the September elections with about 59 per cent of votes.
India has traditionally maintained an interest in the country, largely due to the large number of Indo-Fijians who, at one time, were the dominant ethnic community there before many were forced to emigrate. India traces its ties to Fiji back to 1879, when indentured Indian labourers were brought to work in the sugar plantations. According to the MEA, ""between 1879 and 1916, around 60,000 Indians were brought to Fiji. Beginning with early 20th century, Indian traders and others also started arriving in Fiji.""

While Indira Gandhi was the last Indian prime minister to visit, there has been a steady stream of Fijian leaders, including Bainamarama himself, to India over the years. Bainamarama's last visit here was in 2012.

e05dd8727431bfe1a765646c2f0fe986,"[DOC 1]  India and Russia are trying to put in place a 'Green Corridor'
between the two countries for smooth facilitation of goods to enhance bilateral
trade that has performed far below potential despite the strong political ties.
The issue figured -- ahead of the October annual Summit -- during the meeting between Russian Deputy PM Dmitry
Rogozin and Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj here on Tuesday.
The idea of Green Corridor was mooted by Russia’s Federal Customs Service. It has proposed that the two countries create
a list of entrepreneurs or companies whose goods, on a reciprocal basis, will not have to pass customs inspection during
border crossings, according to sources familiar with the subject.
Russia is already implementing the Green Corridor project with Finland and Turkey. Moscow has also signed such
agreements with China and Italy. The Russian government considers Green corridors as one of the most important levers
for increasing mutual trade. It has been learnt that India has shown interest in the project.
The volume of current Indo-Russian trade is about $10 billion. Both countries have set a target to raise it to $30 billion by
2025, and mutual investment from $10 billion to $15 billion.
“The main advantage of the ‘green corridor’ is that goods being transported by entrepreneurs will not have to undergo
customs inspection and examination when crossing the border -- measures now commonly used to minimize risks. This
also applies to documents. Samples and specimens will not be taken. The provision of original copies of documents is not
needed, and so on,” explained a person familiar with the matter.
Both parties would have lists of entrepreneurs or companies that customs services of the two countries characterize as
“bona fide participants in foreign economic activities”. To include one’s name on the registry, a number of criteria need to
be met: the company must have no outstanding unpaid customs duties and absence of rulings on administrative
violations in the countries among which the project is being implemented.
The mechanism itself should work as follows – an electronic pre-declaration is issued for the cargo, it is assigned a
unique individual number in accordance with the identifier in the “green corridor” registry. The customs inspector thus
already knows what goods are being shipped and does not need to inspect them -- then without stopping, the cargo
passes through the customs clearance post.
In addition, it is assumed that for green corridor participants, there would be a separate post and a special inspector to
serve them at the customs terminal.
Meanwhile, Russia is keen to expand its footprints under the Make in India initiative. During the 5th meeting of IndiaRussia Working Group on Modernization and Industrial Cooperation here in August, both sides expressed interest in
expanding cooperation between Russian and Indian companies in different sectors including mining, fertilizers and civil
aviation.
In the civil aviation sector, Russia is willing to develop Indian technical and production capabilities in this field, and
potential supplies of the jointly produced equipment to third countries. Moscow has sought more information about
Russian companies participating in the $90 billion Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. Russian truck manufacturer
Kamaz wants to set up unit in India.
India has expressed interest to jointly develop iron ore and coal mines in Russia, which will be high on the Modi-Putin
summit agenda besides expanding Indian presence in the oil and gas sector of Russia. The volume of Indian investments
in Russia’s oil and gas sector could reach $15 billion in the next five years. Swaraj and Rogozin also discussed the issues of fast-tracking negotiations of the Joint Study Group on the proposed Free
Trade Agreement (FTA) between India and the Custom Union (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan), hasten development of the
International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), and upgradation of Chabahar seaport as scheduled by 2018 to
improve connectivity to Central Asia and Russia. ","India and Russia are exploring a 'Green Corridor' to boost trade, bypassing customs inspection for trusted companies. The initiative, proposed by Russia's Federal Customs Service, aims to elevate bilateral trade from $10 to $30 billion by 2025.

Meanwhile, Russia seeks to expand its presence in India under the Make in India initiative, focusing on sectors like civil aviation and mining.

The move is likely to boost government revenues and the country's sovereign credit profile.However, Rohit Singla, deputy commissioner in the service tax department, got the shock of his life this week when a large chunk of the ceiling crashed inside his cabin while he was working on a computer six feet away.On the same day, almost the entire roof over the conference room in the same Dharavi office collapsed. To make matters worse, one corner of this service tax building has no electricity.""Since the last two days, with a fear of possible short circuit, we are not working on our computers in that corner,"" said an officer. ""It looks funny, but some officers are working on desktops under open umbrellas in a bid to protect themselves from water leakage (after heavy rain) and collapsing ceilings.""Shishir Agnihotri, general secretary of the central excise superintendent association in Mumbai, told Mail Today, ""The situation is quite dangerous and grave. Every year, during monsoon, we have been working in such pathetic conditions where all our desktops, printing machines, fax machines, cables, etc, have to be covered with big plastic sheets.""On Thursday afternoon, senior officials threw a lunch party for all colleagues to celebrate their entering into the new era of GST from July 1. ""In this excitement, nobody is complaining about such poor conditions. But these incidents are affecting our work,"" a senior commissioner said.The two-storey building is owned by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) that receives annual rent from the customs and excise office.""We have been complaining to MSEB to repair the roof and improve our infrastructure, but MSEB is not taking the matter seriously. In fact, this being a disputed property, the board is unwilling to spend any money on such repairs,"" Agnihotri said.Fortunately, the office has no direct interface with traders and companies to tackle GST-related issues. Also, the income tax office in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) also witnessed a roof collapse that left one official injured. ""It was due to poor maintenance despite informing all the concerned authorities since one year. The CPWD and income tax administration are responsible for this incident,"" a senior IT official told Mail Today.","Around 500 GST officials in Mumbai are working in an office with leaky roofs and no electricity.

Chief Minister Nabam Tuki today approved the demand in principle at Yachuli amidst roaring applauses.

The Chief Minister also expressed serious concern over the burgeoning unemployment problem gripping the state, which in fact is misleading the youths to take up unfair means for livelihood. He urged the youths to channelize their knowledge in creating self employment avenues and assured the government’s encouragement through subsidies and bank loans.

Referring to the PPP policy adopted by his government recently, the Chief Minister assured accelerated development in the sectors like tourism, education and sports infrastructure and cultural activities.

Also citing the major administrative reforms taken up by his government, the Chief Minister said every developmental projects being implemented in the state would be properly monitored.

Sanjoy particularly emphasized on ‘showing the way’ by the sixty elected representatives of the state.

“If the sixty elected representatives work together with a singular vision of development and welfare of the state, then only the 20 million people of the state would prosper and get electoral justice,” he said.  

The MP further asserted in maintaining the indigenous names of places of the state, especially those which have lost their original meaning due to difficulties in expressing the right pronunciations in the written form. On the developmental front, he emphasized on judicious and timely completion of all flag-ship programmes of the government.

Health Minister Atum Welly, in his address, advised for planning before execution of any infrastructure and development projects.

Parliamentary Secretary Likha Saaya extended gratitude on behalf of the people of his constituency to the Chief Minister for addressing the genuine grievances of the area.

c8172e9363271db45a125a2e8d751bfe,"[DOC 1] Intelligence reports and satellite imagery of the line of control bordering Pakistan reveal that the country cleared all launch pads of terrorists in the run-up to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s visit to Washington last week – and then brought them back after his return.

“For several days, we got reports saying there are no terrorists at the launch pads waiting to infiltrate into India. It was very surprising because the period between May and October is when infiltration bids are made,” a senior army officer who has seen the intelligence reports said on condition of anonymity.

Khan met US President Donald Trump last week on July 22. For the first time, a Pakistani prime minister was accompanied by the country’s army chief, General Qamar Bajwa and spy agency Inter services Intelligence’s chief, Faiz Hameed. The assessment in Delhi is that Pakistan did not want any skirmish on LoC to spoil the high-level meeting, a first since 2015.

Fresh intelligence reports now indicate that 200 to 250 terrorists are back at the launch pads waiting to infiltrate into India, the army official added. The ceasefire violation in the Valley’s Gurez sector on Tuesday was an infiltration attempt, the army officer confirmed. “We could see two bodies (of terrorists) lying (there) ,” he said.

An intelligence official confirmed that the launch pads were vacated and the terrorists shifted to villages close to the line of control for the duration of about two weeks. “The border has become active again and we are expecting more ceasefire violations,” this person added on condition of anonymity.

Heavy artillery fire duels between India and Pakistan too escalated this week in the Tangdhar and Keran sector. In another ceasefire violation in the Sunderbani sector, one Indian soldier was killed.

At a press conference in Srinagar on Friday, Chinar Corps Commander, Lt Gen KJS Sandhu said Pakistan was continuing with its infiltration bids and was trying to “disrupt peace in the Valley.”

There was a spike in ceasefire violations after the Balakot air strike at a Jaish-e-Mohammed facility in February, soon after the attack in Pulwama, in which a vehicle laden with explosives rammed into a CRPF convoy, killing 40 troopers.

The border has come alive once again and the thinking in the Indian security establishment is that Pakistan will up the ante. “The assessment in Pakistan is that they had a good trip to Washington and are happy with Trump’s offer to mediate on Kashmir,” an Indian official said, asking not to be identified.","The article discusses recent intelligence indicating Pakistan cleared terrorist launch pads along the Line of Control (LoC) before Prime Minister Imran Khan's US visit to avoid skirmishes. After his return, terrorists reportedly returned to these launch pads, leading to increased ceasefire violations and infiltration attempts into India. Indian security forces have noted heightened border activity and anticipate more violations. The situation escalated following the Balakot air strike and Pulwama attack earlier this year. There is concern in India that Pakistan, emboldened by recent diplomatic developments, may intensify aggression despite international mediation offers on Kashmir by US President Trump."

Candidates contesting the Legislative Council polls on December 10 are said to
be engaged in wooing voters with money and gifts. What’s more, a few candidates
are distributing silver coins with images of deities or posters of gods so that
“god-fearing voters” do not “cheat” after accepting gifts.

BJP candidate for Chitradurga seat K.S. Naveen is said to have distributed to
the voters posters with images of Lord Rama and the Rama temple being
constructed at Ayodhya. Congress candidate B. Somashekhar has taken exception to
the distribution of such posters. In Hassan, the JD(S) leaders are said to have
been distributing silver coins with the image of Lord Manjunatha of
Dharmasthala.

A party worker, campaigning for a candidate in Hassan, said the coins or posters
with images of gods will play a major role in ensuring loyalty of voters. “If
they make a promise to vote for a particular candidate after accepting such
gifts, they normally do not go against it,” he said.

Cash to voters

Recently, a senior leader of a party is said to have distributed cash to voters
in a meeting in Sakaleshpur taluk. The voters were allowed inside the meeting
hall only after surrendering their cell phones outside to make sure cash
distribution is not caught on camera. While one candidate has started
distributing ₹40,000 per voter, another candidate is said to have assured
₹25,000, besides a coupon for a gift.

In Chitradurga, candidates from both the BJP and the Congress are said to have
distributed gifts, during familiarisation exercise. Women voters have got
sarees, while men were invited for a feast. The cash would be delivered by
supporters of candidates on the eve of elections, it is said. “If one party
offers ₹40,000, another is expected to increase it by another ₹10,000 per vote,”
said a voter in Chitradurga.

Viral clip

An audio clip of a telephonic conversation purportedly of Arsikere JD(S) MLA
K.M. Shivalinge Gowda and another person, in which both spoke about cash and
other offers, has gone viral in Hassan.

One of the speakers in the viral video is heard saying that the party lost the

the opposite candidate offered more. This time, the party would be offering cash
and a silver coin, one of the speakers is heard stating.

251df778f30ffeb3d0ea6461548d8555,"[DOC 1] A special hearing in the EU Parliament took place on Wednesday, February 19, revolving around the violence against religious minorities in Bangladesh. Conducted under the #BangladeshStopHate movement, the session was ‘A critical review of human rights violations (2024-25)’ and the assessment of minority rights in Bangladesh.

The speakers who were a part of the hearing were Manal Msalmi, President of the European Association for the Defense of Minorities; Idil Igdir, GHRD Human Rights advisor and advocate; Salvatore De Meo, Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats); Magdalena Adamowicz, Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats); Regina Doherty, Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats);  and Tomáš Zdechovsky, Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).

The special guests for the session were Erik Selle, Leader, Christian Conservative Party Norway; and Himanshu Gulati, Member of the Nordic Parliament.

The speakers had four demands which were put up to the EU Parliament, namely, economic sanctions on Bangladesh, to which the EU responded saying that all loans and grants are humanitarian in nature, and hence, agreed to explore Trade Sanctions. All imports from Bangladesh will attract a GST+ on par with Europe, if the violence does not stop.


And while the Yunus government would appeal against it for sure, it is a big win for the #BangladeshStopHate campaign.

The second demand put up was for EU to appoint an observer delegation to visit the minorities affected areas, on a fact-finding mission; which the EU immediately approved, and Erik Selle was appointed from the campaigners’ side, to lead the delegation. Further, 3 MEP and few Brussels-based Human rights members will visit Bangladesh soon, for which the schedule is expected in few weeks.

The third demand put up was a safe zone territory where internationally monitored safety camps for vulnerable Hindus could be provide; which was rejected by the EU, upon its observation that it is more a prerogative of NATO and not EU.

The final demand was that EU should support a minority political party to ensure there is a democratic representation in Bangladesh; to which the EU said that it was beyond their scope.","On February 19, the European Parliament held a significant hearing under the #BangladeshStopHate movement, addressing ongoing violence against religious minorities in Bangladesh. Titled “A critical review of human rights violations (2024–25),” the session brought together European leaders and human rights advocates to confront rising concerns.

Key figures such as Manal Msalmi, Idil Igdir, and Members of the European People’s Party including Salvatore De Meo, Magdalena Adamowicz, Regina Doherty, and Tomáš Zdechovsky participated. Special guests included Erik Selle from Norway and Himanshu Gulati from the Nordic Parliament.

Four major demands were presented:

Trade Sanctions on Bangladesh – While the EU ruled out economic sanctions due to the humanitarian nature of aid, it agreed to explore trade restrictions, warning that imports from Bangladesh may face GST+ tariffs if violence continues.

EU Observer Delegation – Approved immediately. Erik Selle will lead a fact-finding mission alongside 3 MEPs and human rights officials.

Safe Zones for Minorities – Rejected, as such actions fall under NATO's jurisdiction.

Support for Minority Political Parties – Also declined, being outside EU’s mandate.

While not all demands were met, the session marked a major diplomatic milestone for the movement, bringing minority persecution in Bangladesh into global focus."
dfd4156b081bdce08a0736b8014a12ce,"[DOC 1] India’s executive director at the International Monetary Fund Arvind Virmani
says India could grow faster than China from the middle of the current decade.
The former chief economic advisor however warns against complacency and
highlights the importance of maintaining the momentum through appropriate
reforms. Excerpts:
What’s your outlook for the global economy with a new crisis unfolding
in Ireland?
The concerns related to the European countries affect Europe more directly. So
far as the global picture is concerned, one of the drivers is of course, the US
economy and for a while there was a real concern. I think that concern has
lifted in the last month or so.
The key takeaway from India’s perspective is that it’s going to be a slow
recovery. We should not become complacent about our own growth. Because
the external situation is weak, we really have to depend on our domestic
economy. We must maintain this growth momentum through appropriate
reforms.
Appropriate does not mean huge reforms, but slow and steady, as we have
always done. Europe is clearly rocky. But if you look at recent global growth
history, actually Europe has not been contributing to global growth at all for the
last four years. But they do affect sentiments, and they affect capital flows and
gold prices, and commodity prices and so on.
It’s more a feeling of surprises, uncertainty and the general disquiet which is
the key thing to worry about there. And, therefore, the mechanisms for dealing
with problems. One country’s behaviour or outcome affects another. There’s
little flexibility in the system, which is really the concern.
It’s been two years since the crisis. How insulated are our financial
system from such a crisis, should it strike again?
There are two strands in the global perspective. One is the immediate problem.
What has been done about it and another set of measures in medium to longterm issues. Most of the focus has been on what do we do to avoid future
crisis. But the next crisis may not happen for 30-40 years.
My problem is that short-term has been neglected. Reinhart and Rogoff paper
on history of financial crisis pointed out that it takes an average of eight years
to go back to normal.
For instance, in the US, foreclosure rules applying to households, which made
the crisis worse, needed to be changed to deal with the problems. If they had
been successful in changing this rule so that it did not apply for three years
(say), they could have shortened the period of constrained lending to households. Now it’s going to keep dragging.
What are the key concern areas for India?
My forecast (since 2000) is that we would be growing faster than China by the
middle of this decade. This looks even more likely since the global crises.
But we cannot become complacent. Important lesson from the study of history
is not that you should keep doing big bang reform, but to keep at it, as things
take time. You just have to keep chipping at problems and constraints so that
people have this hope that problems will get sorted out over time.
At the time the crisis hit, I had said the capital flow problem will be the worst
and therefore the financial sector reforms are a must. It turns out that capital
flow problem has not been so bad, partly because of monetary expansion in
the developed countries.
Another issue which I had pointed out was commodity prices and the impact on
the country. That remains. Commodity means oil, particularly because we are
so dependent on oil imports.
The whole oil/energy economy is important and will remain so for a very long
time. So we have to keep reforming this sector. Some important steps have
been taken, like petrol price liberalisation. But we need to keep at it. We have
to understand that this is a long-term issue and we need to become more
energy-efficient over time.
I had also pointed out the importance of food/agricultural reform. Food policy or
agriculture policy reform is a sensitive issue as large numbers depend on it but
we have to start the process.
So, we have to slowly start reforming the whole supply chain, starting from the
production side to the marketing. The reform of the retail sector has to happen.
This inflation problem is going to remain as food prices are driving it.
In the context of impact on fisc, is it advisable to go ahead with the food
security bill without reforming the system?
On the fiscal side, fortunately, there are lessons out there. Greece for one.
Though we are not in that position, it’s a warning nevertheless. Look at UK and
Germany and US now.
Their debt to GDP ratios are going to rise tremendously in the next 10 years
and it’s going to constrain their power and their behaviour. It’s an important
lesson that has been reinforced. The FRBM is very important in the medium
term and lessons of the world tell you that it is very easy to get into these debt situations as they kind of creep up on you.
It’s important to follow the recommendations of the finance commission. It’s
important for the public and the political system to understand that this is very
important if you do not want to be in a situation in which the US is in right now.
","The article features insights from Arvind Virmani, India's executive director at the International Monetary Fund, regarding the global economic outlook and India's growth prospects. Virmani emphasizes the need for India to maintain growth momentum through appropriate reforms and warns against complacency. He discusses concerns related to the European crisis, the resilience of India's financial system, key reform areas for India, and the importance of fiscal responsibility. Virmani suggests focusing on gradual reforms in sectors like energy, agriculture, and retail to address long-term challenges and avoid fiscal pitfalls seen in other countries like Greece and the UK."

Even if not the conventional rags to riches story, Nooyi’s is certainly engrossing, given her origins, and the paths she has since taken. While truthfully claiming itself to be ‘a’ biography, this book is a meticulous collection of Nooyi’s interviews, remarks and speeches at public fora, woven in with a richly imagined personal life culled from a few bare facts, thrown in with recollections from people who knew her.
","Writing a biography of Indra Nooyi, one of the world’s most influential women and CEO of PepsiCo, is no easy task, yet her story is one that clearly deserves to be told. Although not a traditional rags-to-riches tale, Nooyi's journey is deeply compelling, shaped by her modest beginnings and the remarkable path she carved for herself in the corporate world. The biography, while not claiming to be definitive, is a thoughtful compilation of her public interviews, speeches, and remarks. These are interwoven with creatively reconstructed glimpses into her personal life, supported by sparse known facts and recollections from those who knew her.

fbf6c4b62a127a00976dc12acbd5481d,"[DOC 1] Public sector undertakings (PSUs) were created back in early 1950s with two main concerns in mind?one, the scarce private capital to start industry, and two, the need to have certain sectors under government control.

The background is necessary to understand whether we have achieved the objectives and if so, are we willing to move on from there either strategically or otherwise, e.g. space programme or defence industry divestment versus coal or power or railways. The Indian mindset has seen a tectonic shift from the lowest price being the only consideration to the preparedness to pay for quality service. This shift has enabled the launch of the largest PPP programme in the world for the road and power sectors in India.The PSU spectrum stretches from jewel to junk. NTPC, ONGC, Oil India, Power Grid, GAIL are some examples of successful PSUs having ?Ratna’ or ‘Jewel? status. The debate could be initiated on whether or not they could do better, but it is certainly beyond doubt that they have delivered on the objectives. However, it is not glory all the way with cases such as Hindustan Machine Tools, ITI, Scooters India at the other extreme of the spectrum, with no glory to boast of. It would however be unthankful if we do not place on record some softer achievements, e.g. Air India carried out the largest civilian evacuation in the history of mankind during Kuwait Iraq war.

So what are the limiting factors with these PSUs?

Board constituents: The board of a PSU generally has several members who do not necessarily bring sectoral or functional expertise to the table. PSUs need to have

more professionals, scholars/researchers and strategic thinkers on board than at present. This does impact the quality of discussions at the board level.

Tenor of CEOs: The heads of PSUs have a shorter tenor than their private counterparts. By the time a CEO gains expertise in the sector, the company or the operations, the time to transfer or to retire comes calling. PSU banks serve as a good example.

Absence of succession plans: Many a time, the key shareholder of PSUs (read government) does not take timely decisions in appointing CEOs for many months and quarters, leaving the company rudderless. Examples can be found in the road, power and banking sectors. In the absence of a well laid out succession plan and hand-over procedure, PSUs suffer from a dysfunction syndrome.

Vigilance departments: This may be called the British Raj inheritance where shareholders do not trust the persons they have entrusted with responsibilities. More often than not, the shorter tenor of CEOs and fear of an ?inquiry? leads to non-decision. This is perilous in nature. Today, India has privatised several of the key public services and natural resources such as banking and mining. If it is in the private domain, there is no requirement of vigilance, but if it is a government undertaking, vigilance is a must. Different strokes for different folks!

Tendering: Cut-off amounts are so low that the process of making a tender is more expensive than the underlying asset. Do these limits factor in inflation? Practicality? Again, we do not have such preconditions for the private sector. If the objective is to beat corruption, a dispassionate discovery is called for to know whether tendering is perpetrating corruption or restricting it.

Basically, unsuccessful PSUs were established with honourable intentions but are lost leaderless mid-way to reach the present status.

?With virtuous persons, virtues remain virtues. On reaching a non-virtuous person, they become faults. (Just like) a river flowing with sweet water, becomes salty on reaching ocean.?

If the government has the right management and sets right operational controls, financials will improve. Restructuring of those PSUs beyond repairs requires taking a hard call of winding them up and freeing up national resources such as land holdings.

Public offering of PSUs: The offering of PSU shares to general public has several facets to it. One of the most important is the appetite of individual shareholders. The table along tells the story. The PSUs mentioned are some of the most profitable, being leaders in their respective fields and yet the individual holding is where it is. A lot of hard work will go into ensuring a 25% holding by individuals.

The methods of offering shares will also have to be thought through. A straight discount would simply mean passing of a ?grant? which may be unequal, depending on who can subscribe how much. Fiscal implication is another angle in such grant-like offerings. A lock-in period or a unit based offer with several underlying shares? Many options remain open.

Still, the question whether strategic PSUs such as Nuclear Power Corporation should be brought for a disinvestment remains a dilemma. And disinvestment in Ratna PSUs needs strategic planning. The poor cousins thereof, including Air India and its likes, need the government to lead from the front before a selloff.","The discussion on Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) in India reflects a spectrum of challenges and successes, highlighting the complexities of managing these entities effectively. Here are some key points and considerations based on the provided text:

Objectives and Achievements:

PSUs were initially established to address the lack of private capital and to ensure government control over strategic sectors. Successful PSUs like NTPC, ONGC, and Power Grid have indeed delivered on their objectives, contributing significantly to their respective sectors.
Challenges Faced by PSUs:

Board Composition: Many PSUs lack sectoral or functional expertise on their boards, impacting decision-making quality.
CEO Tenure: CEOs in PSUs often have shorter tenures compared to private counterparts, affecting continuity and strategic leadership.
Succession Planning: Delayed appointments of CEOs due to government decision-making processes leave PSUs without clear succession plans, leading to operational instability.
Vigilance and Governance: Vigilance departments and bureaucratic processes sometimes hinder decision-making agility, contrasting with private sector flexibility.
Tendering Processes: Strict tendering limits and bureaucratic procedures can inflate costs and deter efficiency, posing challenges in procurement."

Suffocating summer heat has followed two years of lower-than-average rainfall in Rome, forcing the Italian capital to close drinking fountains and consider the prospect of water rationing.More than a million residents of Rome are facing water rationing for up to eight hours a day as the prolonged heatwave that has ravaged southern Europe takes its toll. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said it was the first time authorities in the spiritual home of the world?s 1.2 billion Catholics could remember being forced to turn off the fountains. Standing in St Peter?s Square, where two fountains by 17th-century sculptors Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini stood dry, Burke said the Vatican wanted to help. ?This is the Vatican?s way of living in solidarity with Rome, trying to help Rome get through this crisis,? he told Reuters TV.The measure was initiated on Monday, and all 100 Vatican fountains will be turned off gradually over the coming days. Rome is gasping after 72% less rain than normal fell in July, according to Sky Italia?s weather TV channel. There was 74% less than normal in June, and a 56% reduction from the long-term average across March, April and May. Caring for the planet and its resources is an important issue for Pope Francis, who demanded swift action by world leaders in the first ever papal document dedicated to the environment. ?This decision is very much in line with the pope?s thinking on ecology: you can?t waste and sometimes you have to be willing to make a sacrifice,? Burke said.

The country was at the 79th spot in last year’s rankings. The Economic Freedom of the World: 2020 Annual Report by Canada’s Fraser Institute has been released in India in conjunction with New Delhi-based think tank Centre For Civil Society.

The report said prospects for increasing economic freedom in India depend on next generation reforms in factor markets and in greater openness to international trade. India reported marginal decrease in size of government (from 8.22 to 7.16), legal system and property rights (from 5.17 to 5.06), freedom to trade internationally (6.08 to 5.71) and regulation of credit, labour and business (6.63 to 6.53).


A score closer to 10 indicates a higher level of economic freedom. According to the report, based on 2018 data, Hong Kong and Singapore once again topped the index, continuing their streak as first and second ranked, respectively.

New Zealand, Switzerland, US, Australia, Mauritius, Georgia, Canada and Ireland round out the top-10.

The report measures economic freedom (levels of personal choice, ability to enter markets, security of privately owned property, rule of law, among others) by analysing the policies and institutions of 162 countries and territories.

The 10 lowest-rated countries are African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Republic of Congo, Algeria, Iran, Angola, Libya, Sudan and Venezuela. Other notable rankings include Japan (20th), Germany (21st), Italy (51st), France (58th), Mexico (68th), Russia (89th) and Brazil (105th).

Centre for Civil Society President Partha J Shah said since the ranking is based on 2018 data, many new restrictions on international trade, tightening of the credit market due to NPAs and COVID-19’s impact on debt and deficits are not reflected in India’s score.","India fell 26 spots to 105th on the Global Economic Freedom Index 2020, down from 79th in 2019, according to a report by Canada's Fraser Institute and New Delhi-based Centre For Civil Society.

Corporation digitizing birth & death documents from 1950
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Soon, birth and death certificates issued by the city corporation dating from 1950 can be accessed online.
The health wing of the city corporation is nearing the completition of the data entry process of birth and death records in the city for the period from 1950-1970. Of the 78,652 records which could be retrieved from the archives, the corporation has completed data entry of 60,072 records.
It has been a laborious process for the staff involved as many of the records were illegible or were in tatters. “We have retrieved as many records as we can for the digitization process. Some of the old records have remained intact due to the paper quality, whereas other old records come off easily from age. We had to handle such records carefully and do the data entry,” said SS Minu, registrar of births and deaths, Thiruvananthapuram city corporation.
The civic body often receives applications from elderly citizens to trace birth certificates dating before 1970. Often, the requests are made by people who wish to travel abroad and stay with their children.

“We were able to retrieve one such certificate which was issued way back in 1933. The request came from a woman who was born in Thiruvananthapuram and then shifted to Mumbai. She wanted to move to the US for which the birth certificate was required,” said SS Minu.
The officials said the whole digitization process would be completed in around three months. Then onwards, old certificates of birth and deaths registered within the hospitals coming under corporation limits can be accessed online. The upcoming launch of the K-Smart app, a new initiative of the local self-government department will also make the process easier, officials said.

The digitization process was earlier carried out from 1985 to 1970. The process involves data entry, verification, and uploading documents online. The old, crumbling registers with pages eaten away by moths make the process even more cumbersome for the officials. In cases where it is difficult to trace the documents, the registrar can obtain sanction from the government and complete the verification process. The worst task is dealing with cases where registration would have involved a series of enquiries.


“All the pages have to be traced back in such cases during the process of verification and if the register is not maintained properly, each page has to be read carefully. Sometimes, the script may not be legible, and we have to piece together the pages to collate information,” said a health official associated with the project.

Once the process is completed, people can download the registration documents online by providing the name, address, or identification number provided in the document.


With the completion of the digitization process, the civic body plans to hand over the old registration documents to the archives department.

","The Thiruvananthapuram city corporation is on the verge of digitizing birth and death certificates dating back to 1950, enabling online access to these vital records. Among the 78,652 retrieved records from archives, 60,072 have undergone data entry despite challenges like illegibility and fragility. Requests, particularly from elderly citizens or those planning international travel, drive the importance of accessing pre-1970 certificates. The process, expected to conclude in three months, involves data entry, verification, and online uploading. The upcoming K-Smart app by the local self-government department will streamline access. However, managing crumbling, moth-eaten registers complicates verification, sometimes requiring government sanction for completion. Once digitization is complete, individuals can download documents online using provided identifiers. Upon completion, the corporation plans to transfer old documents to the archives department. Despite challenges, this initiative promises easier access to vital records, facilitating administrative processes and citizen services."

Hardik made the statement when the victorious Indian team met the Prime Minister at his residence in New Delhi after landing in India on Thursday morning. Hardik was subject to brutal attack on social media from fans in the lead-up to the 2024 IPL season after Mumbai Indians shockingly named him as the captain, replacing Rohit Sharma. It soon turned into boos and jeers from spectators at each of the venues MI played during the tournament, which subsequently affected his performance as well. Speaking to PM Modi, Hardik revealed that despite the difficult phase in his career, he did not lose his cool by hitting back at his critics and rather reckoned that his performance would do the talking.

“The last 6 months have been very entertaining for me, there have been a lot of ups and downs and the public booed me. A lot of things happened and I always felt that if I give any answer, it would be through sports... So I believed that I would stay strong, will work hard,” he said. Moving on from a forgettable IPL season, where MI finished at the bottom of the table for the second time in three seasons, Hardik played a decisive role during the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies, especially in crucial moments for Team India, including the final, where he dismissed the dangerous Heinrich Klaasen before picking two wickets in the last over to successfully defend 16 runs as India won by seven runs. Overall, he scored 144 runs at a strike rate of 151.57 in six innings and picked up 11 wickets throughout the tournament. Hardik's redemption story eventually got a fairytale ending when the same Wankhede crowd began chanting his name when the Indian team were felicitated at the iconic venue on Thursday night. The sight left Hardik startled before he got up from his seat to acknowledge the appreciation from the crowd.","Hardik Pandya, the Indian all-rounder, recently shared his journey of resilience and redemption with Prime Minister Narendra Modi following a challenging phase in his career. After facing severe criticism during the IPL season, where he was booed by fans due to his team's poor performance and his appointment as captain of Mumbai Indians, Hardik remained composed and focused on his game. He expressed to PM Modi that he chose not to retaliate verbally but rather let his performance on the field answer his critics.

His determination bore fruit during the T20 World Cup, where he played pivotal roles in crucial matches, including the final against West Indies. Hardik's contributions with both bat and ball helped India secure their second T20 World Cup title. Despite the setbacks earlier in the year, he finished the tournament with impressive statistics, scoring 144 runs at a strike rate of 151.57 and taking 11 wickets.

His redemption story reached its peak when the same fans who had criticized him cheered for him at the Wankhede Stadium during the team's felicitation. This turnaround left Hardik visibly moved, reflecting the journey from criticism to adulation through his perseverance and dedication to his sport."

To negotiate the unruly Delhi traffic, driverless cars need a whole different level of smarts. In Western cities, traffic rules are followed, signs are obeyed and right of way is given, not taken. It’s anything but in Delhi, and countless other cities in India.


That is why what Intel’s Corp.’s Mobileye unit has showcased through a 20-minute video of an autonomous car navigating its way through the streets of Jerusalem assumes importance. The unedited video showed the self-driving car making its way – the full video is available on its website -- through road intersections without traffic lights, avoiding jaywalking pedestrians and swerving into oncoming traffic like an experienced Delhi cabbie. Like in Jerusalem, drivers in Delhi need to show an intent to move ahead or risk waiting endlessly for traffic to clear up.


Rowdy driving isn’t the only problem that Indian cities face. Barriers to the introduction of driverless cars are many in India – non-existent road markings, potholes and poorly maintained footpaths—but primary among them is the government’s unwillingness to allow it. In September, roads minister Nitin Gadkari ruled out the introduction of autonomous cars because it would leave thousands of people employed as drivers jobless.


But history shows that opposition, even from the government, has rarely, if ever, been able to stop the march of technology.

Mobileye, the self-driving technology company that Intel bought in 2017 for more than $15 billion, uses 12 cameras on its vehicle to navigate the roads. It doesn’t use any other sensors such as radars.

“Our goal is …to do everything that is necessary to do in autonomous driving without relying on any other sensor other than camera,"" Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, said at an event on Tuesday.

But the technology for autonomous cars is anything but perfect at the moment, according to Shashua who is also a computer science professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Mobileye’s immediate target is to limit errors in car sensors to one in every 10,000 hours of driving, which matches with the probability of human-related failures in the US.


“We are targeting a failure in one after every 10,000 hours of driving. If we look at human statistics, 10,000 hours of driving is the probability of an accident with injuries. One million hours of driving, or around that number, is the probability of an accident with fatalities,"" Sashua said at a CES 2020 event in Las Vegas. “But we would like a critical error in one in every 10 million hours of driving, which is an incredible number. There is no technology that is close to those numbers.""

Despite the challenges, Sashua expects to have full-stack autonomous driving technology for robo-taxis by 2022 and for consumers by 2025.

“The full stack self-driving system for consumers that we believe will come after robo taxi, by 2025 we will be able to price a self-driving system with end-to-end sensors, hardware, cable, everything below $5,000. That price point enables installing these systems into consumer vehicles. In the beginning, in premium vehicles but again this is where things start,"" he said. “(It’s) the holy grail of this entire business, when you as a consumer can buy a passenger car that is autonomously enabled.""","In a bid to make autonomous cars safe, Intel's Mobileye unit showcased a video of a driverless car navigating through the streets of Jerusalem, tackling complex scenarios akin to Delhi's chaotic traffic. Despite India's challenges like road conditions and government opposition, technology's march remains relentless. Mobileye employs 12 cameras for navigation, aiming to achieve one critical error in every 10 million hours of driving. Their target is to introduce full-stack autonomous driving for robo-taxis by 2022 and for consumers by 2025, with a projected cost below $5,000."

17f579c98c9f72d3db4bab549ace94e0,"[DOC 1] The Uttar Pradesh government, riding on the global shift to green energy, is looking to attract private investments of up to Rs 50,000 crore in the solar and bio energy sectors.

The state has set a target to generate 22,000 megawatt (MW) of solar power over the next five years. It would comprise 14,000 MW from solar parks and 6,000 MW through rooftop solar power plants.

The government is also drafting a green hydrogen policy in line with the Centre. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the fastest growing in the global landscape in this decade.

UP Energy Minister AK Sharma has directed officials to expedite the drafting of the policy for faster approval by the cabinet.

“The new and additional energy sector will play a major role in making the state a trillion-dollar economy. Efforts should be made to generate sources of employment in the sector,” he said.

Unveiled in February, India’s green hydrogen policy offers cheaper renewable power and financial waivers for interstate power transmission for 25 years for projects commissioned before June 2025. Incentives include land at cheaper rates in energy parks and dedicated zones for local industries.

Green hydrogen is produced by breaking down water in an electrolyser using renewable energy. Later, hydrogen can be combined with nitrogen to make ‘green’ ammonia, thus avoiding planet-warming hydrocarbons. Green ammonia is used to store energy and make fertilisers.

According to reports, the global green hydrogen market was valued at $1.83 billion in 2021, and is estimated at almost $90 billion by 2030, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54 per cent from 2021 to 2030.

Announced in 2021, India’s green hydrogen mission talks about a rapid expansion in production to make the country a green hydrogen hub.

Meanwhile, UP New and Renewable Energy Development Agency Director Anupam Shukla said the state had so far received investment proposals of Rs 18,500 crore in the sector.

Now, the state is planning to proactively contact the domestic and international players in the segment. The energy department will hold an investor meet in January 2023 to sweeten the state’s offer to the private companies.","Uttar Pradesh aims to attract private investments of up to Rs 50,000 crore in solar and bioenergy sectors, with a target of generating 22,000 MW of solar power over the next five years.

Obama and the Republicans said that the latest revelations contradicted his statements that the military was not involved in the shooting.

As a result, Obama said on ABC's This Week that when he fired the shots, it caused no immediate loss. He said the shootings were carried out with no military support.

""I have never supported a position to shoot the American military on the ground in Iraq... I've never said that we were involved in any of that,"" he said.

Obama said this week that he considered the news to be ""too dramatic"" and said all those who claimed to be pro-Assad are lying. His spokeswoman said he did not comment on reports at this time that his administration has called for Assad to be ousted.

The US has conducted airstrikes in Syria and Iraq since March 2015, when US President Barack Obama sent his own military, led by a foreign minister, to a war began after the US-led invasion in August 2014, which was in reaction to the chemical weapons attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Idlib province that killed 85 people.


The US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told lawmakers on Thursday that ""Assad has to be replaced"" and has called for the destruction of government buildings in the province.

""If he is not, he can't be part of the Syrian government,"" she said.

Trump, who has said he supports a no-fly zone in Syria, will join the US president in condemning the killings. Earlier on Thursday, he suggested ""the Russians"" are behind the attacks.


One of the highest-ranking members of the Republican party, Rick Perry, said on Thursday that Trump was right that the US has a long-standing ""rogue dictator"".

""What has happened in Syria has had a long history,"" he told CNN. ""And people must make up their own story. The Russians do not have a dictator in Syria, not a dictator in Iraq.""

Trump said last month that he did not know about the latest evidence that was released on Wednesday confirming Assad did not use chemical weapons on civilians.

Later in the day the White House acknowledged that Assad's government has a chemical weapons programme in place and had released chemical agent the day of the shooting.

Last week, US officials said they had found no evidence that Assad had fired on ""war games"" using poison gas against civilians in July 2015.

The two Russian warships that carried out air strikes on Syria in 2015 and 2016 were launched from the Persian Gulf peninsula of Khobar in the Mediterranean.

At 13.2°C, the maximum temperature of the city was lower than Manali where the maximum temperature was 14.8°C
Though the maximum temperature rose slightly due to the sunny conditions in the afternoon, Chandigarh was colder than hill stations such as Manali and Shimla on Thursday, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The temperatures are likely to drop further during the weekend with rain being predicted for Sunday and Monday.
At 13.2°C, the maximum temperature of the city was lower than Manali where the maximum temperature was 14.8°C. Even Shimla was much warmer at 17.2°C and Dharamshala at 22.9°C.
This comes even as maximum temperature of the city rose from 11.3°C on Wednesday. As Thursday’s day temperature was five degrees below normal, it was categorised as a cold day. A cold day is declared when the maximum temperature goes over 4.5 degrees below normal and minimum temperature drops below 10°C.
The minimum temperature fell from 8.7°C on Wednesday to 8.6°C on Thursday, still 1.4 degrees above normal. While many hill stations were colder at night, the city was still colder than Shimla where the minimum temperature on Thursday was 9.6°C.
Speaking about this, IMD Chandigarh director Surender Paul said, “This has to do with fog which blocks sunlight in the plains. However, we see brighter sunlight in the hills which is why sometimes the maximum temperature of Chandigarh sometimes drops lower than hill stations like Shimla and Dharamshala.”
Flights delayed
Dense fog was recorded in the city on Thursday morning, with visibility going down to 150 metres around 5:30 am on Thursday. As per IMD, visibility between 50 metres and 200 metres is considered dense fog. Chances of dense fog will continue on Friday especially in the morning.

95458b90219f874b6c7ac712dff6ceb8,"[DOC 1] Grab a pinch of soil and you can find over a hundred soil worms or nematodes, says the first global analysis of nematodes. Nematodes are roundworms and their size can vary from a tiny 0.2 millimetre to a few metres. 
A team of over 50 researchers collected over 6,500 soil samples from all seven continents of the world and found that there are about 57 billion nematodes for every human being on Earth. 
The study was done only on the top 15 cm of soil. Their total biomass comes to around 300 million tonnes which is about 80% of the combined weight of Earth’s humans.
 The paper published in Nature  adds that these nematodes are responsible for “around 2.2% of the total carbon emission from soils”. Thomas Ward Crowther, one of the corresponding authors of the study from ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), Zurich adds in a release: “Predicting climate change requires that we understand global carbon and nutrient cycles. We currently have a great understanding of the physics and chemistry of our planet, but we know far less about the biological organisms that drive these cycles. Improving our understanding of these organisms at a global level is critical if we are going to understand and address climate change.” 
 The most interesting finding of the study is this — at 38% of the total, sub-Arctic regions have the highest abundance of nematodes. The temperate region has the next highest abundance followed by the tropical regions. When asked why the worms preferred the cold regions, Johan van den Hoogen, the first author of the study explained in an email to The Hindu that soil organic matter content was the key driver for nematode abundance. The low temperature and high moisture in the sub-Arctic regions reduce the decomposition rate of organic matter. This leads to accumulation of organic matter and the nematodes happily thrive on them. He is a senior scientist at ETH Zürich, Switzerland 
Soils from Western and Eastern Ghats of India and the Himalayas were used for the study. Wasim Ahmad from the Department of Zoology at Aligarh Muslim University was one of the authors of the study and his lab is home to soil samples which have been collected from all parts of India in the past 50 years. 
“In India, ever since the 1992 Earth summit, we have started to talk about biodiversity. But the environment ministry has given more emphasis to the ‘above ground biodiversity’, than the ‘below ground biodiversity’. These nematodes play a crucial role in the environment as they are responsible for production of about 19% of ammonia of the soil. They are also important bioindicators of soil ecosystem health,” says Prof. Ahmad. 
“Various kinds of bacteria, fungi, arthropods and a wide variety of nematodes inhabit the soil. We can study the environmental changes by looking at a small amount of soil as they can represent the entire food web.” he adds.
Prof. Ahmad is also worried that many nematicides have been indiscriminately used in our agricultural fields, posing a major threat to their survival. He urges the use of biological control methods to save these important organisms. ",There are 57 billion nematodes for every human being on Earth

Iran’s supreme leader on June 18 rejected U.S. calls for surrender in the face of more Israeli strikes and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage to them.” 

The second public appearance by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since the Israeli strikes began six days ago came as Israel lifted some restrictions on daily life, suggesting that the missile threat from Iran was easing.

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers that the Pentagon was providing options to President Donald Trump as he decides next steps on Iran but would not say whether the military was planning to assist with Israeli strikes, an action that could risk dragging America into a wider war in West Asia. 

In questioning before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Hegseth said “maximum force protection” was being provided for U.S. troops in West Asia and that it is Mr. Trump’s decision whether to provide Israel a ”bunker buster” bomb to strike at the core of Iran’s nuclear program, which would require U.S. pilots flying a B-2 stealth bomber. He would not indicate what the U.S. may do next.

“They should have made a deal. President Trump’s word means something — the world understands that,” Mr. Hegseth said of Mr. Trump pressing Iran to agree to a deal during U.S. talks over Tehran’s rapidly developing nuclear program.

writing
an e-mail for business or job related communication, these tips will help you give your mails a professional
touch
when you are writing a professional e-mail, you have to be very
careful
about a few things or you might appear very immature or inexperienced.
In professional e-mails, you cannot let your personality show as much as you do in personal mails. Professional or business-related e-mails have to be crisp and to-the point and should contain only relevant information. Read the tips below...
1. Professional
presentation
is a must
being over-creative and over-innovative is a strict no-no. Use standard formats and standard fonts for professional e-mails. Using varied colours of various font sizes in one mail is just going to portray you as an amateur.
Yes
you can convey your individuality but through content and not through wrapping.
2. Keep your e-mail id simple and straight
the first and the foremost thing that could help you establish a professional image is your
email
address. Do not try to be extra creative, clever or confusing. Yes, your e-mail id should portray your professional capacity but in a simple way. It can either be your full name or your middle initials or something related to your profession but not something irrelevant like sexycelina@gmail. Com.
3. Always use a professional e-mail signature
as a professional person, you want to leave a lasting impression on a recipient and a key point of knowing how to write professional emails is how to sign off. Your signature is your identity and is left in every message. If you are seeking employment, it is vital to include your name, contact details and alternative phone numbers. This is all part of representing yourself as a professional and finding common ground with other professionals.
4. No
emotions
or emoticons in e-mails
there is a lot of difference between sending a casual text to a friend and sending a formal mail. In casual chats, we frequently use smileys and emoticons to express what we are feeling. For any professional e-mail, this kind of expression may be considered very inappropriate. You will certainly not put a happy face in the subject of your e-mail when applying for a job. One important tip when writing professional e-mails is that you should allow emotions to dictate your writing. Whether you are happy, sad, frustrated or annoyed, first calm down before you write an e-mail. And even after writing it, double check before you hit the send button.
5. Be careful when using humour
there is a fine line between the between humour and sarcasm and this is very difficult to achieve in writing. There are chances you will be misinterpreted or misunderstood which may not only make you sound very personal but also ruin your image. The same goes for abbreviations or acronyms, frequently used today. Do not use it until you are very sure they will be well-understood.
6. Run a grammar and spell check
do check your standard of grammar and spellings when writing a professional e-mail. Spelling and grammar errors can portray you as a bad communicator. Remember, first impression is the last impression. If you were a recruiting manager, would you hire someone with poor language skills? Certainly not! So read your mail at least twice to check for errors after writing it.","To give your professional email a professional touch, follow these tips:

1. Use standard formats and fonts for professional emails. Avoid using varied colors or font sizes in one email. Instead, convey your individuality through content.
2. Keep your email address simple and straight, showcasing your professional capacity. Include your full name, middle initials, or something related to your profession.

 The agreement was reached following a meeting between Odisha Chief Secretary and the Union Coal Secretary. The SPVs, one each for Talcher and Ib valley, would be formed between Mahanadi Coalfields, the public sector units under Indian Railways and the State government for construction of railway infrastructure to ease coal movement. The move gains significance in view of the fact that coal evacuation is now emerging as the single largest bottleneck in increasing availability of the fossil fuel to the power plants and other user-sectors.
 
 Production is increasing at a faster clip than coal evacuation and may become the single largest bottleneck in the government’s plan to take coal production to one billion tonnes by 2020 from its sub-500 million tonnes level now. This apprehension has been expressed as much by the CIL leadership as the Coal Ministry.
 
 During a meeting here in mid-January, Union Coal Secretary Anil Swarup had said that the issue had been taken up with the Railway Board. The Coal Ministry had identified 50 rail projects to ensure evacuation of coal from the mines.
 
 Sources told The Hindu that additional railway lines would help improve the turnaround time for wagons. “Under these SPVs, the Railways will acquire the land needed for laying the tracks, while MCL will provide the funds (it has a 64 per cent stake in the SPV).
 
 It may be mentioned here that as far as September, 2012 the need to have these infrastructure was highlighted. MCL is gradually emerging as one of CIL’s largest producers.

b47b894447ce657459d5e2b131dbefb2,"[DOC 1] England survived a scare from Ireland before rain forced the abandonment of their Group D match and they moved into the Super Eight of the World Twenty20 at the Providence Stadium in Guyana.

Rain that conspired England's downfall against West Indies Monday came back to their rescue after 24 hours as Ireland gave themselves a good chance of scoring an upset restricting England to 120 for eight with some stellar bowling and fielding display after captain William Porterfield decided to bowl.

But only 3.3 overs were bowled in the second half when skies opened up for the second time after the innings break. Ireland were 14 for the loss of one wicket and no play was possible after that.

England would have breathed easy that five overs were not completed as the match would have then settled on the Duckworth Lewis (D/L) method that was held responsible for their loss against West Indies by England captain Paul Collingwood.

The D/L cut off was just 27 runs in five overs for Ireland to knock out England from World Twety20.

Ireland which caused one of the biggest upset in world cricket when they beat Pakistan in the 2007 ODI World Cup in the Caribbean would have fancied their chances against England.

A day after putting up a brilliant batting performance against West Indies, England's inconsistency with the bat came to the fore. And had it not been for the Ireland-born Eoin Morgan (45) and Luke Wright (20), who were the cornerstone in team's batting against West Indies, England were staring at a disaster.

Morgan struck 45 from 37 balls as England struggled for every run on the slow and sticky surface.

Ireland's battery of medium-pacers stifled England's batsmen. Veteran Trent Johnston led the attack bowling a tight line. He claimed the wicket of Collingwood, and gave only 14 runs in his four-over spell.

England openers Michael Lumb and Craig Kieswetter shared 24 runs before the former was out to Kevin O Brien (2-22). Kieswetter was run out and star batsmen Kevin Pietersen's (9 off 18 balls) harrowing time came to an end when he was caught in the deep midwicket off Brien.

England were quickly reduced to four for 49 before Morgan and Wright steadied the innings. But after they were separated, England again lost quick wickets in the final overs with medium fast Boyd Rankin doing the damage.

Ireland's left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who is also tournament's youngest bowler at 17, was impressive with figures of 19 runs from four overs.","England narrowly advanced to the Super Eight in the World Twenty20 after their Group D match against Ireland was abandoned due to rain at Providence Stadium in Guyana. England struggled to 120 for eight, thanks to Ireland's strong bowling, particularly by Trent Johnston and George Dockrell. Eoin Morgan’s 45 was crucial. Ireland, at 14 for one in 3.3 overs, had a chance to win via the Duckworth-Lewis method but the rain prevented further play, rescuing England. The D/L method, which previously led to England's loss against West Indies, would have favored Ireland with a target of 27 in five overs."

The bulbous vegetable, bursting with flavour, has been known for its many nutritional benefits. It helps improve immunity, lower the risks of heart diseases and regulates blood sugar levels.

Lately, many content creators are sharing videos suggesting chewing garlic cloves is the key to clear, acne-free skin. Digital creator and dermatologist Dr Andrea Suarez shared an Instagram reel saying, “The most bioactive compound in garlic is Allicin. It is formed and released when the garlic clove is crushed. I suggest crushing garlic prior to consumption, so as to ensure you are getting this beneficial compound.”

Indianexpress.com spoke to Dr Priyanka Kuri, consultant–dermatology, Aster Whitefield Hospital, Bengaluru, and found out whether this is just another TikTok viral myth or if it is worth the stinky breath!
Can garlic consumption cure acne? What is the ideal amount of consumption?
“There is no scientific evidence to claim consuming garlic cloves can single-handedly reduce acne,” said Kuri. She also said that she would not recommed applying garlic topically on the skin. “Applying raw garlic on acne spots may lead to contact dermatitis and irritation,” she said.
What are the health benefits associated with garlic?
“Garlic’s components, like allicin and thiosulfinates, possess anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also an excellent immunity booster. Including garlic in your diet can offer multiple ancillary benefits, potentially aiding in maintaining clear skin,” she elaborated. However, she cautioned against specific daily consumption targets, as excessive intake may lead to heartburn, acidity, and persistent bad breath.
“Garlic that has aged and dehydrated slightly tends to be more potent in its health benefits,” she noted.

381cef362a48eb9b3511852f2002f32b,"[DOC 1] With the petitioners in the ongoing PIL case on Salwa Judum asking for the formation of a high-level committee to oversee the rehabilitation of displaced persons in Chhattisgarh and deal with criminal matters arising from the activities of the state-sponsored anti-naxal movement, the Centre, through the Solicitor-General, on Thursday told the Supreme Court that it agreed to the setting up of a panel but needed time to work out the details.

In their plea before a Bench of Justices B. Sudershan Reddy and S.S. Nijjar, the petitioners, Prof. Nandini Sundar and others, said the court should direct the Centre and Chhattisgarh to withdraw all support, either direct or indirect, (financial or moral or logistical) to any armed vigilante group, including Salwa Judum by any of its names and cease arming civilians.

Senior counsel Ashok Desai, appearing for the petitioners, said schools and hostels which are still being occupied by the security forces must be vacated and a high-level committee to monitor rehabilitation and criminal justice constituted.

When Chhattisgarh counsel submitted that schools be run at alternative sites without disturbing the paramilitary personnel stationed there, Justice Reddy said, “We are not going to buy this argument. You have to vacate the schools.”

It was simply not acceptable for the security forces to occupy schools and displace children, he said.

The court also ordered police protection to one of the petitioners, Manish Kunjam, a former CPI MLA.

In proposals submitted to the court, the petitioners said the State government should be asked to vacate all schools, hostels and public buildings by December 31, and to ensure that they were not occupied by armed or security forces in future for whatever purpose and that the schools were restored to the appropriate educational authority.

On relief and rehabilitation, they said a high-level committee should be constituted to oversee the comprehensive rehabilitation in Dantewada and Bijapur districts, including registration of FIRs.

For this purpose, a Rehabilitation Plan might be designed keeping in mind the model suggested by the petitioners in March 2010. They wanted compensation of Rs. 4 lakh paid in cases of death, rape or incapacitation.

The process of restoring essential services like the PDS, schools, anganwadi and health workers to villagers should be started immediately.

The Bench posted the matter to December 15, asking the Centre and the State to file their response to the proposal.","In the ongoing PIL case on Salwa Judum, petitioners have requested the formation of a high-level committee to manage the rehabilitation of displaced persons in Chhattisgarh and address related criminal issues.

154581ad4c79b4ff7cb30899eb285ae3,"[DOC 1] A holiday is no tribute to a man who said work is worship. If you really want to honour Gandhi, go out and try to be the change you wish to see, writes Barkha Dutt.
I hate to disrupt the cozy comfort of a long weekend. But should Friday really have been a holiday? Why have we reduced the birthday of the country’s most iconic leader — one who continues to emblazon our imagination — to a sarkari farce? Tragically, Gandhi Jayanti is now all about perfunctory rituals, postage-stamp tokenism and the enforced prohibition that has come to be the hallmark of national holidays. And if you really want to enforce something, why not, make it a day for mandatory civic duty? Let people get out and pick up the ice-cream wrappers flung about on the lawns of India Gate. Or let them get hold of a broom and wash down the drains behind their homes. Or, even just plant a tree. I still remember an image from a few years ago on the Mahatma’s birthday — Rahul Gandhi lugging a mound of mud on his shoulder, walking behind a barefoot woman in a pink ghagra, chipping in with daily wagers at a construction site. I thought that single image captured the essence of what Gandhi stood for better than countless anniversary rituals at Rajghat. Despite his critics saying it was a slick photo opportunity, as messages go, it was in my view, the right one to send.

Our failure to commemorate Gandhi in a meaningful way has much to do with hypocrisy and literalism. We have drowned the Gandhi legacy in bucketfuls of political correctness and scrubbed away its colour, its robustness and its brilliant potential for contemporariness. We also get sidetracked by too many meaningless arguments over who can claim Gandhi and in what fashion. So — when Mont Blanc comes out with pens crafted in white gold to commemorate him — we huff and puff in faux outrage. How can a luxury company peddle Gandhi for profit, we proclaim. We act all shocked because he stood for austerity after all and now there are billboards of him promoting a pen that costs Rs 11 lakh a pop. But isn’t this anger a whole lot of humbug?

After all when Apple used Gandhi’s image for its ‘Think Different’ campaign, didn’t we feel a sneaking pride at the global resonance of an Indian leader. Or if you logged onto Google in the last 24 hours and saw Gandhi’s face woven into the search engine’s typography, didn’t you feel a sort of quiet pride at being Indian? I’m sure neither Apple nor Google were being altruistic when they used Brand Gandhi. Business agendas would have been woven into their plans as well. But, because their products sound more respectable than, let’s say, an overpriced pen, we work ourselves into a lather over the latter.

Frankly, this is probably our own middle-class guilt at the lives we lead, than anything else. To apply Gandhian values so literally, divorced from the context they once existed in, is to limit our understanding of the man and his essence. I would never bother buying the Mont Blanc pen, but as I see it, if the advertising campaign around the ‘Mahatma Gandhi Limited Edition-241’ helps publicise the 241 miles of the Salt March that Gandhi and his followers did on foot, I think, it’s no harm done at all. Yes, it is the dichotomy of India that the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and a luxury edition pen both seek to be christened after the Mahatma. But, well, that’s India, and Gandhi is an idea that no one can put an ownership tag on.

You only have to consider the irony that it was a beer baron who brought Gandhi’s belongings back home to underline how complicated it is to straitjacket what can be called ‘Gandhian’ today. It was Vijay Mallya who made the winning bid in New York and spent almost $2 million to claim many of Gandhi’s personal belongings, including his iconic round-rimmed glasses. Interpreted literally, ‘Kingfisher’ may seem incompatible, even antithetical to what goes by the cliché called ‘Gandhian values’. But, if it takes an unabashedly ostentatious business czar to bring back Gandhi’s belongings to India, I’m all for it.

I think too often we forget that Mahatma Gandhi was both himself and a symbol of something larger. And in his case, it’s that symbolism that is dynamic, and, therefore, eternal. So, when Gandhi-baiters wonder whether he would be relevant today, they should instead ask a different question. Would Gandhi in 2009 been the same as he was in 1939? Or would he have created a different syntax for the times? The reason that Gandhi remains a universal inspiration is because he stood for the ‘power of one’. He showed what a solitary individual could do to create mass mobilisation. He was like the Pied Piper of politics leading a country to self-discovery and strength.

As long as we remember and honour that, it doesn’t matter whether auction houses or business barons want one piece of the Gandhi pie. Remember, ‘Munnabhai’ may have done more to make Gandhi trendy than a million earnest tomes. And next time you get all weepy when you see Attenborough’s tear-jerker on him (I cry without exception every time I watch it) tell yourself that on the next Gandhi Jayanti, you will go out and make a small difference to the world we live in. That would be the best possible tribute.","The author expresses dissatisfaction with the way Gandhi Jayanti, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, is observed as a national holiday. The article criticizes the reduction of the day to ""sarkari farce"" with perfunctory rituals and enforced prohibition. The author suggests that instead of a lazy holiday, the day should be dedicated to mandatory civic duty, such as cleaning public spaces or engaging in community service.

The piece reflects on the literalism and hypocrisy surrounding the commemoration of Gandhi, emphasizing the need to embrace the essence of his legacy rather than drowning it in political correctness. The author mentions instances where Gandhi's image was used for commercial purposes, arguing that such expressions contribute to the global resonance of the Indian leader.

The article encourages a broader understanding of Gandhi's values, beyond literal interpretations, and acknowledges the complexity of defining what is truly ""Gandhian"" in contemporary contexts. The author highlights the dynamic and eternal symbolism associated with Gandhi, emphasizing his ability to inspire individuals to create mass mobilization and make a difference in the world."

fe9513bd79c7923c386f435a63e39c7e,"[DOC 1] On 25 03 2022, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority said that the annual change in the WPI works out as 10.76607% during the calendar year 2021 over the corresponding period in 2020. This means that the prices of essential medicine are set to rise by ten per cent. There was continuous lobbying by a group that represents over 1000 Indian pharmaceutical manufacturers that has urged the government to allow drug-makers to increase prices of all non-scheduled drugs by 20% as the pharmaceutical industry battles rising input costs. At present, non-scheduled drugs are allowed a maximum annual price increase of 10%. Consumers, already reeling due to galloping prices of essential commodities, may have to shell out more for essential medicine like painkillers, anti-infectives, cardiac drugs and antibiotics. The government is set to allow drug companies an increase in line with the change in the annual wholesale price index. In this connection, it is worthwhile to revisit an earlier guideline with regard to the prescription of generic drugs by medical practitioners. The Medical Council of India-made regulations in 2002 that are binding on all doctors and state: ""Use of Generic names of drugs: Every physician should, as far as possible, prescribe drugs with generic names and he /she shall ensure that there is a rational prescription and use of drugs."" Any violation of these guidelines will be a deemed a 'misconduct' which may result in initiation of disciplinary action against the violating doctors. As per clause 8.2,if the medical practitioner is found to be guilty of committing professional misconduct, the appropriate Medical Council may award such punishment as deemed necessary or may direct the removal altogether or for a specified period, from the register of the name of the delinquent registered practitioner. Deletion from the Register shall be widely publicized in local press as well as in the publications of different Medical Associations/ Societies/Bodies.

At the time of their registration, physicians sign a declaration that includes the following: ""I shall abide by the code of medical ethics as enunciated in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations 2002"" From the above it is clear that it is mandatory for medical practitioners to prescribe generic drugs as far as possible and failing to do so may amount to misconduct which may warrant their removal from registration.  A generic drug may be defined as a medication created to be the same as an already marketed brand-name drug in dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use. These similarities help to demonstrate bioequivalence, which means that a generic medicine works in the same way and provides the same clinical benefit as the brand-name medicine. It means that one can take a generic medicine as an equal substitute for its brand-name counterpart. Generics are cost-effective alternatives to brand name drugs, which can be used interchangeably, but can be sold at a fraction of the cost. These medicine are identical to brand name drugs in dosage, strength, route of administration, performance characteristics, safety and intended use. While inaugurating a charitable hospital in Surat in April 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed that the government will bring in a legal frame work under which doctors will have to prescribe generic medicines which are cheaper than branded drugs to patients.  It is not known why the existing provisions prescribed by Medical Council of India are not being strictly enforced. Possibly, it is because of the invisible hand of a powerful pharmaceutical lobby.  The government must not only enforce the provisions but take action against those who do not prescribe generic drugs.","In 2022, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority announced a 10% rise in essential medicine prices due to increased wholesale price index. Amidst rising costs, there’s pressure to allow a 20% price hike for non-scheduled drugs. Doctors are mandated to prescribe generics, but enforcement is lax, possibly due to pharmaceutical lobbying."

BJP State Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said that the Congress Party, which has become the symbol of dynasty, should look into its own deeds before accusing the BJP. For the last 22 years, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, the President of the Congress, have been playing musical chairs among themselves, added Shahdeo.
“Mrs. Sonia Gandhi from 1998 to 2017 and Rahul Gandhi from 2017 to 2019 then Mrs. Sonia Gandhi as the President from 2019 to the present. Since independence, the Gandhi family has ruled the country directly or by sitting on one of its pawns,” said Shahdeo.
The plight of PV Narasimha Rao can never be forgotten, said Shahdeo, adding that the treatment meted out to him was an example of how the Gandhi family treats outsiders. In the same way, after the death of Sitaram Kesri, his body was also kept in the Congress building, he said.
The BJP spokesperson said that it is the same Congress party whose MLA Irfan Ansari, who is a symbol of dynasty himself, says that Guru ji should become the Chief Minister, now his son Hemant Soren is the Chief Minister and in the future Hemant Soren's son will also become the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Shahdeo said that Mahatma Gandhi had probably conceived this dynasty and said to end the Congress party after independence.
Shahdeo said that in the BJP, every leader is on his own ability or he has contributed to the party for a long time. It is not the culture of the Congress party here that a pilot should become the Prime Minister of the country overnight and the leader who got a fake degree from Cambridge should be considered the most capable by its workers.              
","The BJP State Spokesperson criticized the Congress Party for being a symbol of dynasty, pointing out the long history of the Gandhi family's rule within the party. He highlighted instances where outsiders were mistreated by the Gandhis, and contrasted this with the BJP's culture of promoting leaders based on merit and contributions to the party. Shahdeo also mentioned a Congress MLA who is seen as a symbol of dynasty himself, suggesting that the party's focus on family connections undermines democracy."

Aceclofenac gets rapidly converted to diclofenac after being injected into the water buffaloes.
Aceclofenac in water buffaloes poses the same threat to vultures as it is a pro-drug of diclofenac.
 
What was diclofenac?

Diclofenac — an anti-inflammatory drug — was banned for veterinary use by the Government of India in 2006.
It was found to be the main cause of a dramatic decline (99 per cent) of the vulture population across Asia.
The drug caused accidental poisoning in raptors after they fed on carcasses of cattle injected with it.
 
What does the Vulture action plan 2020-25 says?

It advocates the prevention of misuse of veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by ensuring their sale only on prescription.
It also recommends that veterinary treatment should be given only by qualified veterinarians which would prevent the overuse of NSAIDs in treating livestock as the toxicity of most of the drugs is dose-dependent.
It promotes the scientific manner of disposal of livestock carcasses so that vultures do not get exposed to the carcasses of animals that died during treatment.
Vulture Action Plan 2020-2025 also mentions Aceclofenac as ‘toxic’, asking the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) to ban its veterinary use — along with other drugs like nimesulide and ketoprofen.

“We are trying to send not only Zaheer but all others in the Test squad too who are not part of the ODI team. The only issue is logistics, the availability of the required number of hotel rooms,"" said BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel.

Zaheer Khan, opener Murali Vijay, one-down batsman Cheteshwar Pujara, reserve wicketkeeper Wridhiman Saha and left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha are part of only the Test squad.

Having drawn the three-Test series on their last visit, the Indian side, without stalwarts like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman this time around, nevertheless has high hopes.

“We are all confident of doing well in South Africa. We did well in England and then in the West Indies (in ODIs, though). Our aim is to do well in South Africa and win the series,” said Shikhar Dhawan, India’s flamboyant opener.

And there’s a reason why one can’t dismiss Dhawan’s talk of “doing well” as mere bravado. The left-handed opener had, after all, done pretty well in South Africa when he went there with India A a few months back. In one of the List A matches, he had smashed 248 against South Africa A. And that’s what he seems to be counting on. “We have the advantage of having played on these pitches and performed well. I can take confidence from that on this tour,” he said.

Fair enough, but it must be mentioned that the quality of the pitches and obviously the attack is going to be vastly different from what was served during the A tour. And given the drama played out between the BCCI and Cricket South Africa preceding the tour, the hosts might be tempted to spice up the wickets a little more and prove their supremacy on the playing field, if not in the boardroom.

And in such a scenario the experience of someone like Sachin Tendulkar would have come handy for the team. ""Sachin paaji was a great player and we will miss him. His experience and presence in the dressing room was big for us. But the good thing is our batsmen are performing well and we have a great fielding side, and that’s a big bonus,” Dhawan said.

India are undoubtedly riding high following their consistent showing in the ODI format over the last six months and some young, talented players like Dhawan coming through. It’s, however, the upcoming tour that’s going to determine how good this team and its individual members are.

—With agency inputs","The BCCI is preparing for India's upcoming Test series in South Africa by sending Test specialists early to acclimatize, similar to their strategy in 2010-11. Despite missing key veterans like Tendulkar, Dravid, and Laxman, the team remains optimistic. Shikhar Dhawan, drawing confidence from his successful India A tour, believes in their ability to perform well. However, challenges loom with potential pitch variations and a competitive South African team. Dhawan acknowledges the absence of Tendulkar's experience but highlights the team's strong batting and fielding capabilities. The tour will test India's current form and the resilience of its young talent."

6a2ec40c23e9b6979e56914b42e20f4d,"[DOC 1] RAIPUR

The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) on Monday said that a former managing
director of the Chhattisgarh State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MARKFED
henceforth) and an office-bearer of a local rice millers’ association pulled off
a “Custom Rice Milling special incentive scam” in the State, generating ₹175
crore bribes for the “benefit of higher powers”.

With less than a fortnight to go for the first phase of Chhattisgarh elections,
the latest ED claim comes as another arsenal for the Opposition that has been
targeting the State’s Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government over other alleged
scams connected to coal levy, liquor sales and online betting. The ED is probing
money laundering angle in all these cases as well and has arrested, or named as
accused, several bureaucrats and politicians.

According to the ED, the latest alleged scam is connected with a special
incentive that the State government pays to the rice millers for custom milling
of paddy. This incentive amount, an ED statement said, was “exorbitantly”
increased from ₹40 to ₹120 per quintal and then “payments were released worth Rs
500 Crore, generating kickbacks of Rs 175 Crore”.

These alleged kickbacks were purportedly received from rice millers in lieu of
facilitating the passage of bills to claim the special incentive. They had to
pay bribes at the rate of ₹20 per instalment for each quintal of paddy milled,
according to ED, and the amounts were “collected by the office bearers of
Chhattisgarh State Rice Millers Association under the leadership of its
Treasurer, Roshan Chandrakar, in connivance with Manoj Soni, [then] MD,
MARKFED”.

MARKFED is a body that executes paddy procurement under Price Support Scheme and
supply of chemical fertilizers and plant protection material to the farmers of
the state as per the instructions of the Government. According to the ED, “the
bills of only those rice millers who had paid cash amount to the association
were cleared by MD, MARKFED for payment”.

Explaining the process of this purported verification method, i.e. which bills
were to be cleared, the ED statement said first, the details of rice millers who
had paid the cash amounts were sent by the district rice millers association to
the concerned District Marketing Officers (DMOs). These DMOs, upon receiving the
bills of rice millers, cross-checked them with the details received and passed
the information on to the head office of MARKFED, the ED press statement added.

The agency in its statement said that it had conducted search operations on
October 20 and October 21 at the premises of ex-MD of MARKFED, Treasurer &
Office bearers of Chhattisgarh Rice Millers Association, District Marketing
Officers, and few Rice Millers in connection with the scam and that it initiated
investigation on the basis of a Complaint filed by Income Tax Department under
various sections of Information Technology Act, 1961 and Indian Penal Code, 1860
before a Raipur court.

The drama unfolded in the presence of policemen in the lobby of the new Legislators' Home (LH), on the Vidhana Soudha premises.

The mayor, who belongs to the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samithi (MES), was waiting in the lobby with his party's former MLA B I Patil and Belgaum ex-mayor Shivaji Suntikar when a group of Kannada Rakshana Vedike volunteers gheraoed them, threw black colour on them, roughed them up, tore their shirts and made them stand in their trousers.
The activists, led by Praveen Shetty, shouted slogans condemning the Belgaum City Corporation's resolution favouring merger of Belgaum with Maharastra. The protesters asked More ""to go to Maharashtra"". The group fled the scene even as the policemen on duty at LH were mute witness.


""We have registered a case against Shetty. An ACP-rank officer has been asked to nab Shetty and his group,"" DCP (Central) G B Chebbi said.
The police are contemplating action against the policemen who were on duty in LH for not preventing the unlawful action, Chebbi said, admitting it was a security lapse.

When the cat, rather big cat, is away, the mice will naturally play, and this has been proved by the Samajwadi Party. SP president Akhilesh Yadav, along with his family, is holidaying in London and will return home next month.

With the big boss away, the party has got completely into party mode. The spokespersons have conveniently forgotten the murky bungalow episode and are not even bothering to ask the Yogi Adityanath government to produce the inventory about items that were claimed to have gone missing when Mr Yadav vacated the bungalow.


A veteran party leader said: “The state government has failed to produce any record of all that reportedly went missing. The party should now aggressively attack the Yogi government and demand action against concerned employees and also an apology from the government. Instead, everyone is in a holiday mood.”

When asked, a party spokesperson said: “Don’t we have a right to take a break? I am also taking my family on a vacation.”

It sure is a holiday time in the SP in Uttar Pradesh.

Caught in his own trap
Odisha chief minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik never knew he would be caught in his own trap just a day after writing a letter on Thursday to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an official notification to recognise hockey as a national game.


Just when his party spokespersons went gaga on television screens over their leader’s letter to the PM with a hope that the demand would further add to the promotion of “Brand Naveen” ahead of the 2019 general election, the BJP and Congress leaders demanded a gazette notification recognising Bande Utkala Janani, an Odia song written during the freedom struggle by Kantakabi Laxmikanta Mohapatra, as the state anthem. A number of social organisations also made the similar demand.

“It’s good that the Odisha CM has demanded national game status for hockey. He must show equal concern for the state anthem status to Bande Utkala Janani,” they said.

Sources said the CM found the demand a tough one as granting state anthem status to Bande Utkala Janani would be a suicidal step for the fact that the people of Western Odisha, who are demanding a separate state of Koshal, are strongly opposed to the word “Utkala” in Bande Utkala Janani.

The grapevine has it that the CM, after realising that he has been caught in his own trap, has asked his spokespersons to play down his demand on hockey","The absence of SP President Akhilesh Yadav, vacationing in London, has led to a lax attitude within the party regarding issues like the missing inventory from his vacated bungalow. Despite calls to demand action from the Yogi Adityanath government, party members seem more focused on holidaying. Meanwhile, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik faced backlash after his demand for hockey's national game status was countered with calls for recognition of a state anthem, Bande Utkala Janani. Patnaik's spokespersons are now downplaying the hockey demand amidst concerns over the anthem issue."

If he is so poor, we offer him free gas supply for six years,” Parra said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been appealing for months that the well-off people should give up LPG subsidy so that benefits could be diverted to the needy poor people.Responding that appeal earlier, Abdullah had said in July that it should be left to the conscience of the MPs whether or not they want to give up the LPG subsidy.Asked whether he had given up his LPG subsidy, he had said, “Don’t worry about me.

transgender and gender nonconforming students. Based on their feedback we will lay
down guidelines and policies. SANJAY GOEL, director, Delhi govt’s Directorate of Education
NEW DELHI: The Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) said that within a
year it will come up with guidelines to make its 1,100 schools “inclusive” for
transgender students. The department plans to “train” principals of all government-run
schools on handling issues relating to transgender students.
On Tuesday, the DoE organised a workshop for 25 government school principals in
collaboration with an NGO.
DoE director Sanjay Goel said the project, a first of its kind, hopes to eliminate “stigma”
that transgender students face. “We first need to train our principals and teachers to
identify transgender students. If they come across anyone, they should know how to
deal with them. They should know how to reach out to them and understand their
special needs and challenges. And for that they need some training and sensitisation,”
he said.
The workshop was organised in collaboration with a Delhi based non-governmental
organisation SPACE (Society for Peoples’ Awareness, Care and Empowerment).
Anjan Joshi, co-founder of SPACE, said they are currently working on an anti-bullying
policy with schools. “We are currently working with 30 schools — 25 government and
five private — to come up with anti-bullying policies to safeguard the rights of
transgender students, as well as to make fellow students aware about the transgender
issues. We need to work together to remove this ‘trans-phobia’ from educational
institutions,” she said.
While there are no accurate numbers of how many students in the country are
transgender identified, there are many academic reports that detail the discrimination
and abuse that transgender persons face at school. Experts say a majority of
trainpersons drop out of school on account of sustained harassment.
Since 2014, after the Supreme Court’s judgement which granted the right of selfidentification of gender, many universities have taken steps to include transgender
students. In July, for instance, Kerala announced that it will reserve seats in its state
university. Last month, Uttarakhand High Court directed the state to provide
scholarships and financial assistance to transgender persons. However, no such
reservation exists at the primary, secondary or high school level.
Goel said that absence of transgender students in higher education is a testimony of the
“adversities” they face in schools.
“A few years back there was a transgender student in my school, whose parents
disowned him despite several counselling sessions imparted by the school. However, I
should have reached out to that student and talked to him, but most of us are not aware
of how to handle this,” said a principal of a South Delhi school, who spoke to HT under
the condition that they remain anonymous.
By next year, the government plans to complete the training for all principals and
teachers across its 1,100 schools in Delhi.
Shashikant Singh, the principal of a senior secondary school in Dwarka Sector-2
suggested that there should be a provision that children need not mention gender at the
time of admission. “Students do not know their gender identity when they enrol in
schools. They understand themselves gradually,” he said.","The Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) is taking proactive steps to make its schools inclusive for transgender and gender nonconforming students. Here are the key initiatives and plans outlined:
The DoE organized a workshop for 25 government school principals in collaboration with SPACE (Society for Peoples’ Awareness, Care and Empowerment), an NGO focused on transgender issues.
The aim is to train principals and teachers on identifying transgender students, understanding their needs, and addressing their challenges sensitively.
Within a year, the DoE plans to develop comprehensive guidelines to ensure inclusivity for transgender students across its 1,100 schools.
Feedback will be collected from workshops and used to shape policies that support transgender students in accessing education without stigma."

The largely unmarked 4,057-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China has peace at hand after both sides accused each other of scores of border transgressions last year. What could make it happen is India's experience with Pakistan on keeping in touch at the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level to ensure border tranquility.

Government sources confirm that New Delhi has invited Deputy Chief of General Staff (CGS) of China's People's Liberation Army for talks on setting up more border meeting points and hotlines between the top military leadership of the two countries.

The Defence Ministry has cleared a formal invite, to be sent through the Ministry of External Affairs, to the PLA's Deputy CGS, who deals with operational issues and day-to-day matters, sources said. The PLA has no such post as DGMO, so the invite is directed to a General who will talk to the Indian DGMO, Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia.

A source said: ""The process has just started, but the aim is to ensure peace. A direct contact between the top military brass will help in keeping either side in check"".

This is in line with the Border Defence Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) inked on October 23 last year during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Beijing.

India has similar DGMO-level arrangement with Pakistan. The DGMO's communicate with each other every Tuesday over a special hotline. They met last month in December at the Wagah-Attari land crossing and vowed to maintain ceasefire.

The BDCA proposes 'mutual consultations' to facilitate contacts and meetings between relevant organizations. It refers to establishing border personnel meeting sites in all sectors, as well as telephone contacts and telecommunication links at mutually agreed locations along the LAC. It points to setting up a hotline between the military headquarters of the two countries.

At present there are three meeting points for Brigadier-level officers to meet at Spanngur Gap in eastern Ladakh, Nathu La in Sikkim and Bumla in Arunachal Pradesh. There is keenness to have two more meeting points - one at Kibithoo in eastern Arunachal and the one in Himachal Pradesh. As an interim measure for the first time Brigadier level officers met on January 1 at Bumla. Normally, the meetings take place on six-designated days in a year. Brigadiers on either side of the divide can also seek a flag meeting on any contentious issue.

What's on table

* The invite for DGMO-level contact follows Border Defence Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) between the two sides during PM Manmohan Singh's visit to China last October

* BDCA proposes 'mutual consultations'. It refers to establishing border personnel meeting sites and keeping a hotline

* The 4,057-km LAC is unmarked. Usually, as per protocol, troops withdraw at seeing each other. Yet at times a stubborn face-off follows like the one at Depsang plains, Northern Ladakh, in April last year","On January 12, 2014, India proposed expanding military-level communication with China by initiating DGMO-level talks, aiming to reduce border tensions along the 4,057-km Line of Actual Control (LAC). Drawing from its experience with Pakistan, where DGMOs maintain weekly hotline contact, India has invited China’s Deputy Chief of General Staff (PLA doesn’t have a DGMO post) for direct communication with Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia, India’s DGMO.

This move aligns with the Border Defence Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) signed during PM Manmohan Singh’s visit to Beijing in October 2013. The BDCA promotes mutual consultations, establishment of border personnel meeting sites, telephone contacts, and a military hotline.

Currently, there are three Brigadier-level meeting points: Spanggur Gap (Ladakh), Nathu La (Sikkim), and Bumla (Arunachal). India seeks to add two more—Kibithoo in Arunachal Pradesh and another in Himachal Pradesh. The initiative aims to institutionalize structured dialogue and prevent incidents like the Depsang Plains standoff in April 2013."

The animals were removed from the JIPMER animal facility Thursday, and handed over to animal rights organisation PETA India for rehabilitation in a sanctuary with the necessary enrichment and veterinary services they need.

The rescue was approved by central regulatory body, Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) after PETA India alerted it to gross violations of animal protection laws at the medical institute. In response, CPCSEA sent a show cause notice to JIPMER demanding that the illegal experiments be stopped immediately and warning of legal action. PETA India then offered CPCSEA and JIPMER permanent rehabilitation of and lifelong care for the animals at a suitable sanctuary.

“While these animals have been spared a lifetime of misery and pain in a laboratory, there’s still work to be done to keep more animals out of experimenters’ hands,” says PETA India Science Policy Advisor Dr Ankita Pandey.

“We hope this incident encourages institutes across India to use only non-animal methods of experimentation and teaching,” she stated.

As per a whistle-blower complaint received by PETA India, the rescued rats and mice were being kept in miserable conditions at JIPMER – confined to severely crowded boxes and forced to eat food contaminated with fungus – in violation of CPCSEA regulations and guidelines. The animals were also reportedly bred to overpopulation, and students were allegedly forced to perform experiments on them solely to reduce their numbers.

According to various research publications by JIPMER in the last decade, the animals were subjected to painful experiments in which they were forced to consume drugs and chemicals, deliberately infected with diseases, and subjected to mutilating procedures, after which they were ultimately killed, PETA India noted.

In its letter to CPCSEA, PETA India noted that JIPMER had not renewed its registration licence since 2012, yet continued to breed and conduct experiments on rats and mice and fund illegal experiments, even after CPCSEA cancelled its registration on 5 May 2022. The group pointed out that this is a direct violation of the Breeding of and Experiments on Animals (Control and Supervision) Rules, 1998, which prohibit breeding and experimenting on animals without CPCSEA registration.

In its complaint, PETA India submitted evidence of cruelty and illegal activities at JIPMER, including photographs, Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) circulars inviting research proposals using animals, minutes of IAEC meetings during which illegal animal experiments were approved, memorandums releasing research grants to support proposals involving animal experiments, and published research papers that discuss experiments conducted on animals by the institute in the past decade.

The animals were found in appalling conditions, reportedly bred excessively, and subjected to painful experiments and poor living conditions, leading to intervention by PETA India and the CPCSEA. JIPMER was accused of conducting illegal experiments despite its registration being canceled by the CPCSEA in 2022.

ae708b3b2d730ca7b858804672743256,"[DOC 1] CHENNAI: Will doctors be allowed to retrieve vital organs from a patient who is on life support after a cardiac arrest but has been deemed to have no chance of a life? Heart and lung surgeons from across the state on Saturday campaigned for harvesting organ from a patient even before he/she is declared ‘brain dead’ at a scientific and technical meeting organised by the state transplant authority at the multi-speciality hospital on the Omandurar government estate.
Normally, patients who suffer massive cardiac arrest an electrical disorder of the heart when it stops beating are connected to the heart-lung devices such as ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) machine. “After some time there is clear scientific indication that the heart cannot be revived. Most of these patients have good kidneys and liver that can help someone else,” said senior cardiac surgeon Dr K R Balakrishnan.
If surgeons have to do that they will require radical changes to the organ transplant rules, said TRANSTAN (Transplant Authority Government of Tamil Nadu) member secretary Dr P Balaji. “There was a near two-hour discussion to iron out differences, methods to improve organ quality and on how to increase the organ pool,” he said.

Experts like him say there is a window of opportunity available in the present act which defines a ‘deceased person’ as “a person in whom permanent disappearance of all life occurs, by reason of brain-stem death or in the cardio-pulmonary sense, at any time after life birth has taken place. “But we don’t have the rules or guidelines like in the case of brain death,” said urologist Dr Sunil Shroff, founder of MOHAN Foundation that campaigns for cadaver donation programme. Many countries, for instance, have a no-touch time – the time given to ensure there is no life – that varies between five minutes and 20 minutes.

Most doctors present at the meeting said that encouraging donation after circulatory death was one of the best ways of pushing up organ donations. In England, about 33% of transplants are said to happen due to donation after cardiac death (DCD). “We must look at all possible ways to increase organ transplantation and make judicious use of all organs,” said Madras Medical College dean Dr Narayanababu. The Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital is one of the heart transplant centres in the state where transplants are done free of cost.

When doctors in the government sector pointed out that it may be difficult for them to put patients on ECMO as it would be expensive and sometimes wasted if a transplant isn’t possible, doctors from the private sector suggested a corpus fund. “Doctors now pay Rs 1,000 to register all patients. They are now willing to pay more if we promise to use this as corpus fund to maintain donors. The fund can be used by both government and private hospitals to prevent major loss and encourage smaller hospitals to promote donations,” said Dr Balaji.","Heart and lung surgeons in Chennai are advocating for the retrieval of organs from patients on life support after cardiac arrest, even before being declared brain dead. This proposal, discussed at a state transplant authority meeting, aims to increase organ donations. Currently, patients with massive cardiac arrests are connected to ECMO machines, but their hearts often cannot be revived. Surgeons argue that organs like kidneys and livers could still be viable for transplants. Implementing this would require changes to organ transplant rules. A corpus fund was suggested to support ECMO costs and encourage donations from both government and private hospitals"

The students then ran down and damaged vehicles of teachers and BSEM officials parked inside the school campus by pelting stones.
The school’s Economics teacher RK Milan and over 20 students sustained injuries in the violent uproar.
Altogether two cars, two vans and four two-wheelers were also damaged although the situation was brought under control with the arrival of security forces.

Modi. Presently, there is more focus on Nitish Kumar and Arvind Kejriwal in comparison to Rahul. But, it is also being said that Rahul is still hesitant
Party work is continuing like routine work for Amit Shah. On January 24, he was elected for the post of the BJP president for three years and the next day, he
held a rally in West Bengal and discussed the election preparations with the State leaders. Sources of the BJP say that Amit Shah’s fate was almost decided
so he was working as per his strategy; which is why he is not making any changes in the organisation with immediate effect.
The present organisation of the BJP has been created by him. Of course, some State presidents will be changed; Bihar, UP, Jharkhand and Delhi are the
important ones. Some new faces will come into the organisation and some will join the Government. But all these will be done like routine work. It is said
that Shah has identified all the faces.
On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also gathered the details of work done by the Government. Modi has held meetings with the
secretaries and judged the pace of work of all the departments. Those who are not working as per expectations will be removed and will also not get any
work even in the organisation. Half a dozen ministers who are working hard may get promoted. But, Budget and elections are ahead so the party will be
busy in election and ministers will be preparing the Budget. The Government needs massive management for the Budget Session and at the same time the
organisation has to put its whole strength for the election in five States. So, we have to wait to see the changes.
KEJRIWAl AND DElHI
Congress is at loggerheads with the AAP. Congress leaders are much worried that AAP may spoil its game in Punjab. If AAP dents the vote bank of Congress,
the party will suffer losses in Himachal and Gujarat also. That is why the Congress leaders are repeatedly targeting AAP. But, when the Central Government
decided to impose President’s rule in Congress governed Arunachal Pradesh, it was the AAP which opposed it before any other opposition party. Arvind
Kejriwal stood with Congress on this issue. His party officially informed Congress that it would extend full support to it in this case in Parliament also.
It is said that Delhi is the reason behind Kejriwal’s restlessness. leaders of the AAP are apprehensive that the Central Government might dissolve the
Government in Delhi also. Recently, AAP leaders discussed this issue too. Close aides of Kejriwal think that citing reasons of instability, anarchy and the law
and order situation of Delhi, the Central Government might impose governor’s rule in Delhi. They are also apprehensive that the Central Government may
also abolish the half State status of Delhi. It means Delhi might return to the pre-1993 situation when there was no Assembly in Delhi.
RESTRUCTURING CONGRESS
Congress may face organisational changes. Rahul Gandhi has told the journalists who met him that there is no connection between his taking command of
the party and organisational changes within the party. He has indicated that there might be significant changes in the party even before he takes charge of
it. Probably, many old General Secretaries can be changed.
Reliable sources say that barring CP Joshi, BK Hariprasad and Gurudas Kamat, all the General Secretaries will not be given any other chance. leaders of the
party are saying that Rahul himself will make the changes and the caste equations will be taken care of. Sources say that in place of Mukul Wasnik, who is a
Dalit face, former IAS officer K Raju can be accommodated. He is the man who is steering the Dalit politics of the Congress.
likewise, it is said that Jitendra Singh may come in place of Digvijaya Singh and Ajay Maken may find space in place of Ambika Soni. Though Maken is the
State president of Delhi, Rahul feels that there is nothing to do in Delhi. Randeep Surjewala may also be appointed General Secretary and can be continued
as media in-charge. From women’s quota, Meenakshi Natarajan can be made the General Secretary. From UP, either RPN Singh or Jitin Prasad may be
appointed the General Secretary.
RAHUl AND HIS FORMUlA
Amidst the news of possible changes in Congress, suspense is continuing over two questions: When will Rahul become the president of Congress and will
his formula be implementedIJ Sonia Gandhi wants to hand over the command of the party to Rahul as soon as possible. She feels that when Rahul is taking
all the responsibilities of the party president, he should officially take charge as well. She believes that when he does it officially, only then will he be taken Out of these 12, eight will be from OBC, Dalit, minority and women. There will be only four General Secretaries from the general quota. Sources close to
Rahul claim that this formula will not be implemented very rigidly. It may be possible that there will be five or six General Secretaries from general quota.
At present there are three Brahmin General Secretaries, but it might reduce to two in the new committee. Dr Shakeel Ahmad may be sent to the Rajya Sabha
from Bihar so there is much speculation over a new Muslim face.
ElECTIONS BEFORE TIME IN J&KIJ
Suddenly, there is a debate over the pre-scheduled Assembly Elections in Jammu and Kashmir. Supposedly, National Conference and Congress are behind
such debates and discussions. It is said that for the last few months, BJP’s top leadership, especially Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, has not been paying
attention to the affairs of Jammu and Kashmir. Reliable sources say that the top leaders don’t want to bow down before the hard bargaining of Mehbooba
Mufti. This doesn’t send good message among the BJP supporters. That is the reason why the BJP has left all the responsibilities to former deputy CM
Nirmal Singh and party General Secretary Ram Madhav.
On the other hand, Sonia is taking special interest in the affairs of Jammu and Kashmir. Ghulam Nabi Azad is advising her. That is why she had gone to
Srinagar to condole the death of Mufti Mohammad. People are saying that NC and Congress have moulded the politics of J&K as per their own wish. These
parties have created such an atmosphere that it is sending the message that people of the Valley are miffed with PDP whereas the people of Jammu are not
happy with the BJP.
And that is the prime reason why the Peoples Democratic Party and BJP have become defensive. Sources say that both the parties don’t want election at
this stage because they fear a huge loss. But, Congress and NC have led to the speculation of a pre-schedule election. Both the parties are expecting
benefits out of this politics. Sources say that both the parties are working on the new equation. Congress leaders are in contact with the PDP so that the
Government can be formed and on the other hand, leaders of the NC are communicating with the BJP. leaders of NC are trying to gain in both the situations;
if election is held, they are hopeful of regaining their base and if the election is not held, they are hopeful of gaining power with the BJP.","Sonia Gandhi believes that Rahul Gandhi will only be taken seriously as Congress president when he officially takes charge, as current attention is focused on Nitish Kumar and Arvind Kejriwal. Meanwhile, Amit Shah continues routine organizational work for the BJP after being re-elected as president, with some state leaders expected to change but no immediate major shifts planned. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is evaluating departmental performance, with potential promotions for hardworking ministers, while also preparing for upcoming elections and the Budget Session.

Congress is worried that AAP could undermine its support in Punjab, Himachal, and Gujarat, even as AAP has supported Congress against the imposition of President’s rule in Arunachal Pradesh. Changes in Congress leadership are anticipated, with Rahul Gandhi indicating that he may make significant alterations before officially taking command. Speculations include replacing several General Secretaries and ensuring representation from OBC, Dalit, minority, and women communities.

In Jammu and Kashmir, discussions about pre-scheduled Assembly Elections are emerging, with National Conference and Congress appearing to shape the political landscape to their advantage. Both the PDP and BJP are reportedly reluctant to hold elections, fearing losses, while Congress and NC are exploring potential alliances for government formation."

Dr Chauhan said that what had baffled the medical fraternity in the city was that she had no known history of travel to any area affected by swine flu or any interaction with suspected patients. However, he added that her kin had failed to provide proper information about her itinerary and interactions.“Four of her relatives reported symptoms of swine flu, but they were tested negative. They were administered precautionary treatment,” he said.

He added that a survey by the animal husbandry department had not traced any signs of the disease in the animals in Amritsar.

The minister, who toured Moraghat where the elephants were mowed down by a goods train on foot, was taken aback when he came to know that the pachyderms were not together when they were ""slaughtered"". The train driver did not bother to stop or slow down after knocking down one elephant. He seems to have proceeded unperturbed and killed six more.
""At what speed was this train travelling? I am meeting railway minister Mamata Banerjee next week. Night-running of goods and non-stop express trains should stop along this stretch. Of the 27 elephants that have been mowed down by trains in the last seven years since the tracks were converted to broad gauge 23 have been killed during the night. The latest deaths were similar to what happened in Bhopal,"" Ramesh said.
Locals and NGOs organized a protest during Ramesh's visit and also raised accusing fingers at the Bengal forest department. State forest minister Ananta Roy had already been targeted by organizations like Adivasi Vikas Parishad when he turned up at the spot during the day. Environment activists and locals pointed out to Ramesh that Roy had not found time to visit the area, in spite of the tragedy, though he belongs to nearby Cooch Behar.
The forest department has identified 44 spots between New Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar Jn where elephants and other wild animals are prone to crossing the railway tracks. While 20 of these are within the forest, the remaining are on the fringes. Till now, the railways has imposed speed restrictions along a 30-km stretch. Forest department
officials believe that trains should not run at a speed of over 25-30 kmph along the entire stretch.
""It is not possible to determine the exact location from where an elephant herd will emerge and attempt to cross the tracks. The railways needs to be aware of the situation. More so as we are on our way to setting up the national elephant conservation authority. The railways will have to take steps for doubling of the tracks between New Jalpaiguri and New Alipurduar. A number of trains can then be diverted,"" Ramesh said.
The doubling will cost nearly `600 crore and sources revealed that the railway ministry is seriously contemplating taking it up. The state forest department has proposed to set up 10 control towers along the train route that passes through the forests of Buxa, Jaldapara, Chapramari, Apalchand and Mahananda, apart from several fragmented forested areas.
Roy announced that the state finance department had already cleared the appointment of 550 forest guards. Bonbondhu groups on the lines of those set up around the Sunderbans would also be set up, consisting of volunteers","Union Minister Jairam Ramesh likened the death of seven elephants in Dooars to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, urging the immediate cessation of night-running freight and long-distance trains between New Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar. Ramesh emphasized the need for speed restrictions along the tracks and proposed doubling the railway lines, costing approximately ₹600 crore. Locals and NGOs protested during Ramesh's visit, accusing the Bengal forest department of negligence. State forest minister Ananta Roy faced criticism for not visiting the site promptly. The forest department proposed setting up control towers and appointing forest guards to mitigate further incidents."

UHWC guidelines say these centres should offer care for ENT, mental health issues and basic oral health.However, during spot-check TOI found that there were halls and rooms, and little else. There were no screening devices nor furniture for medical professionals or record-keeping. Many of these centres were hardly equipped to offer the designated services. The Manali UHWC had a table for the doctor in the waiting room, while the remaining three rooms were totally empty. Lab services were yet to operate and none of the major equipment like screening devices, IV facility and glucometres had arrived. There was no laboratory sink too.At West Mambalam, all the three rooms on the first floor were empty and were bging used as storerooms. Dr Dharshini said the unit needed an ultrasound machine for pregnancy screening, besides more beds in the rooms. “People lack awareness about these centres. Since there are bigger hospitals in the vicinity offering more facilities, they go there,” said the doctor.At the Santhome centre, there was no separate pharmacy room, and all the medicine were found stacked inside the patient’s room itself.Finding doctors is the bigger problem, as services here are available only on contract basis with little long-term career prospects. Many of them quit soon after joining, said a doctor from Teynampet zone said. The work hours too are odd. “Both urban primary centres and the UHWCs open at 8am. But UHWCs close at noon and reopen at 4pm. Doctors have nowhere else to go and nothing else to do during this strange four-hour break time,” said the doctor.A Ramalingam, state general secretary of PG Service Doctors Associations, said both UHWCs and UPHCs should be taken over by the state health department, as in the case of districts. “If the state recruits doctors on permanent basis, they will be assured of a career and research growth internally. It will be an incentive for medical professionals to stay on and contribute to the success of such initiatives,” he said.Former director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy said only if these centres are armed with cancer screening machines, oral detection kits, pregnancy care and NCD testing, major hospitals will get unburdened. “A patient would need a specialist doctor for the first check up, but a UHWC doctor would do for follow-ups. For this, the doctor should be trained to read specialty doctors’ reports and necessary supportive equipment should be there,” he said.When contacted, GCC commissioner Dr J Radhakrishnan said as UWHC is a good concept meant to provide ancillary care to people. “We are working on to create awareness about these centres and funding proposals are being given to address the gaps,” he said.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.","Chennai's 140 Urban Health and Wellness Centres (UHWCs), built at a cost of Rs 88 crore, are facing challenges in delivering quality healthcare services.

The objective would be to help the consumers withstand the high costs and encourage businesses to cope with high energy prices.

The government announced on Thursday that money would be infused into the economy by injecting €200 billion. The war in Ukraine has led to a situation where Russian energy prices have shot up, and Germany has to reinvest into the economy to help the people fight the high prices.

The government's pitch to the citizens is that help will come through the ""defensive shield."" During the global recession and the Covid pandemic, the German government used the ""defensive shield"" to create a cushion for ordinary citizens.Gas is an essential commodity in Germany, and it is used to heat homes during winter, produce electricity and help provide power to factories.

The government had earlier planned to levy a surcharge on the citizens to bring down the rising cost of purchasing fuel on the global market, but it is now being scrapped.

Instead of the surcharge, the government would pump €200 billion. This investment  is Germany's idea of fighting back against Russia. Germany won't be cutting taxes like the UK and weakening the currency in the bargain.

Scrapping a planned citizen surcharge, the government opts for the €200 billion investment instead, aiming to counter Russia's impact without tax cuts or currency devaluation, distinguishing its strategy from the UK's approach amid the crisis."

3f300ec9b3fe0e20741beb61eef8861c,"[DOC 1] In an unfavourable turn of events, inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was at 3.65% year-on-year in August, up from 3.60% in July, and surpassing Mint 's consensus estimate of 3.5%. Given the generous rainfall seen in August, expectations were that retail inflation would moderate as vegetable prices ease.

The unexpected uptick was largely driven by higher-than-expected food inflation, while core inflation remained benign.

“We believe that higher food price inflation is a statistical issue. Until July, food prices were higher. Now, although food prices are falling, it is not being reflected in the CPI data,"" pointed out a Nomura Global Markets Research report dated 13 September.

More here | August inflation: What CPI data tells us beyond the base effect, in charts

The critical question now is how this affects the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) anticipated timeline for interest rate cuts. The August CPI reading reduces the probability of an October rate cut to about 60%, down from 70% prior to the release, according to the Nomura report.

The RBI's next policy meeting, scheduled for 7-9 October, will take place after the September inflation figures are released. The weather department has forecast above-normal rainfall for September, and the development of La Niña conditions towards the month's end will be crucial for the monsoon's withdrawal. While headline CPI inflation remains below the RBI’s 4% target, news regarding food prices remains concerning.

“Daily retail prices indicate pick-up in food prices (on a month-on-month basis) in September. This is based on prices for the first two weeks,"" said an IDFC First Bank report dated 12 September.

While the price trend for vegetables is mixed, those of cereals and pulses continue to decline, but the pace has reduced, added IDFC whose preliminary estimate for September CPI is 5.1%, after building-in a small month-on-month rise in food prices. Thankfully, easing global crude oil prices could provide some cushion to energy inflation.

But that’s not all. There is another important development that needs to be monitored and could weigh on RBI’s decision on interest rate. “The four-year term of the three external members in the monetary policy committee concludes next month and new members might be named ahead of the October rate review,"" Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank, Singapore, said in a note.

Interestingly, latest RBI meeting minutes show that two of the existing external members in the Monetary Policy Committee are in favour of cuts versus the majority whose decision is to hold on rates. “Incoming members might prefer to maintain the status quo in October but follow a broader MPC shift in December as more inflation and growth prints become available,"" Rao added.

The RBI has kept key policy rates unchanged for more than 18 months now.

On the global front, the European Central Bank lowered its deposit rate by 25 basis points to 3.50%, in line with expectations. Attention now turns to the US Federal Reserve, which is set to meet on 17-18 September. The Fed is expected to begin its monetary policy easing cycle with a 25 basis point rate cut. One basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point."," Consumer Price Index (CPI) was at 3.65% year-on-year in August, surpassing Mint's consensus estimate' The August CPI reading reduces the probability of an October rate cut to about 60%, down from 70% prior to the release, according to a Nomura report."

SANKARSHAN THAKUR New Delhi, July 20: The stage is being set for the most prickly battle for power in Jammu and Kashmir in decades. Not least because the ruling allies â€” the National Conference ( NC) and the Congress â€” formally parted ways today, bickering even about who was the first to flash divorce documents.

The lame duck alliance remains in power for the while but the partners are now in open slugfest ahead of Assembly elections due in October- November.

The Congress announced today it would contest all 87 Assembly seats on its own, calling curtains on the six- year power alliance. But Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and NC chief Omar Abdullah moved swiftly to claim he was the first to pull the plug on it 10 days ago.

His decision to go it alone in the forthcoming Assembly polls was spelt out in a private meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi 10 days ahead of the Congress's announcement, Omar said.

Omar's NC, too, intends fielding candidates in all Assembly segments, rendering the contest multi- cornered and potentially the keenest in recent memory. Other contenders for power in J& K include the Modi- fired BJP and Mufti Mohammed Sayeed's People's Democratic Party ( PDP).

Since 2002, the PDP and the NC have taken turns to rule the state with coalitions.

The Congress has been part of both ruling dispensations ( with PDP in 2002- 2008; with NC in 2008- 2014) and even had a spell in the hot seat when Ghulam Nabi Azad took over reins from the Mufti as part of an internal power- share agreement.

( Jammu and Kashmir is the only Indian state mandated to six- year Assembly terms.) Shortly upon the announcement from Ambika Soni of the Congress today, Omar put out a tweet saying it was the NC that had decided to part ways.","The political landscape in Jammu and Kashmir is set for a fierce battle as the National Conference (NC) and Congress formally ended their six-year alliance, each claiming to have initiated the split.

Both parties plan to field candidates in all constituencies, making the upcoming October-November Assembly elections highly competitive.

40b246f6783de3cb9277354a234ed6f9,"[DOC 1] On June 15, 2017, Congress member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor claimed that 23 of the BJP-led government’s new programmes were merely renamed versions of schemes launched by the previous governments led by his party.


Another Twitter user made the same claim on June 11, 2017.

We found that 19 of the 23 programmes were indeed renamed versions of older schemes, as Tharoor claimed.


Here’s our analysis:

Claim 1: Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana=Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account

Fact: True

Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account (BSBDA) was a no-minimum-balance service with all facilities of a normal banking account except that withdrawals were limited to four a month, according to this Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular dated August 17, 2012. The accounts came with an automated teller machine (ATM)-cum-debit card too.

The BSBDA accounts were also meant for beneficiaries of government programmes, according to this answer in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Parliament) on December 13, 2012.

Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), launched on August 28, 2014, an accident insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh, overdraft facility up to Rs 5,000 after six months and a life insurance of Rs 30,000 were added to BSBDA accounts.

Unlike BSBDA, PMJDY accounts had a credit limit of Rs 1 lakh because of which pension reimbursements were getting rejected, The Financial Express reported on September 8, 2016.

While BSBDA covered only villages with above 2,000 population, PMJDY has been extended to all areas–rural as well as urban.

“They are more or less the same. All accounts opened prior to August 28, 2014, were BSBDA. Since then, they have all become PMJDY accounts. It’s only a change of nomenclature,” Prem Singh Azad, deputy general manager, Allahabad Bank, who is involved in the bank’s financial inclusion programme, told IndiaSpend.

Claim 2: Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana=National Girl Child Day programmes

Fact: True

The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA)-I declared January 24 as the National Girl Day in 2008-09 and several objectives associated with previous continuing programmes were adopted as targets.

Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana (BBBPY), launched in January 2015 under the ministries of women and child development, health and family welfare and human resource development, was a consolidation of old programmes scattered across schemes and ministries under the UPA government.

For instance, the girl child education programme of BBBPY was a repackaging of older education schemes such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, according to this February 2016 report by the Centre for Development and Human Rights, a research and advocacy organisation in New Delhi.

Similarly, BBBPY’s objectives of improving the child sex ratio and reducing school dropout rates among girls were already present in the UPA’s Dhanalakshmi and Sabla schemes, respectively. Dhanalakshmi was later discontinued as states already had better schemes in place.

Claim 3: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan=Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan

Fact: True

In September 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government approved a proposal that Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan scheme be restructured into Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, according to this government release.

Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan was the new name adopted for the Total Sanitation Campaign on April 1, 2012 under UPA-II, according to the Abhiyan’s guidelines.

Total Sanitation Campaign was the new name given to the Central Rural Sanitation Programme–launched by the Congress in 1986–in 1999, according to the drinking water and sanitation ministry’s website.

Claim 4: Sardar Patel National Urban Housing Mission=Rajiv Awaas Yojana

Fact: True

“The government is shortly going to launch a comprehensive programme named Sardar Patel National Housing Mission by merging and improving existing urban housing schemes,” The Pioneer reported on October 10, 2014, quoting Housing and Poverty Alleviation Minister Venkaiah Naidu.

A parliamentary committee, headed by Biju Janata Dal member Pinaki Mishra, had even asked the government in December 2014 how merely changing the name could accelerate implementation, The Telegraph reported on December 30, 2014.

Claim 5: Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin)=Indira Awaas Yojana

Fact: True

A parliamentary standing committee report–submitted on August 31, 2016–pointed out that Congress’s Indira Awaas Yojana was “rechristen[ed]” Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin).

The “Guidelines”, “Scheme Allocation” and “FAQs” on the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) website still open Indira Awaas Yojana documents.

Claim 6: Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana=Rajiv Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana

Fact: True

The UPA’s Rajiv Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana was “subsumed” under Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana, according to this government release on July 23, 2015.

Claim 7: Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation=Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission

Fact: True

NDA’s urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu had said on assuming office that they would replace Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) with their own urban renewal schemes, The Hindu reported on May 29, 2014.

Subsequently, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), smart cities Mission and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Urban) were launched on June 25, 2015.

JNNURM was launched on December 3, 2005, for an initial period of seven years and then extended for two years up to March 2014, according to this Rajya Sabha answer on December 6, 2012.

A comparison of some key objectives of the two programmes shows that under the NDA government, the targets of UPA’s umbrella programme have been spread over several schemes.

The “sectors covered under JNNURM and [AMRUT and other urban development programmes] overlap significantly,” according this March 2016 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, a global consultancy .

“[V]arious urban sector components [that] were earlier addressed through a single mission (JNNURM) … have now been split across missions [such as AMRUT, Smart Cities Mission and Swachh Bharat Mission],” the report said.

Comparison of Urban Development Programmes - Sources: Ministry of Housing and 
Claim 8: Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana=Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme

Fact: Unclear

Three older programmes– Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme of the water resources ministry, Integrated Watershed Management Programme of the land resources ministry and the On Farm Water Management of agriculture and cooperation department–were merged to create the NDA’s Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, according to Yojana’s website.

As government websites (click here, here, here, here and here) do not reveal when exactly the programme was launched in 1996, it is difficult to check this claim, as three prime ministers–Congress’s P.V. Narasimha Rao (till May 16), BJP’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee (May 16-June 1) and Janata Dal (Secular)’s H.D. Deve Gowda (June 1 onwards)–governed India during 1996.

The watershed management programme goes back to the late 1980s when the country was mostly under Congress’s rule.

Claim 9: BJP’s neem-coated urea=Congress’s neem-coated urea

Fact: True

Neem-coated urea was included in the Fertiliser (Control) Order of 1985 in 2004, according to government-owned National Fertilizers’ website, and was notified on June 2, 2008, according to this government communication.

It was finally included in the 1985 Order through an amendment on February 6, 2017.

Claim 10: Soil Health Card scheme=National Project on Management of Soil Health and Fertility

Fact: True

A soil health card was “added” to the National Project on Management of Soil Health and Fertility, according to the Outcome Budget 2015-16 of the agriculture and cooperation department.

The centre would earlier provide support to states for issuing soil health cards under the central scheme, according to Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament) answers (click here and here).

Under the UPA government, soil health cards were also issued under the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture, one of its several organic-farming programmes, according to the Outcome Budget 2015-16. This scheme was also merged with NDA’s renamed Soil Health Card programme.

Claim 11: Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana=Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and other programmes

Fact: True

“Some existing components … have been clubbed together as a cluster based programme and named Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana,” according to the Outcome Budget 2015-16 of the agriculture and cooperation department, FactChecker reported on July 22, 2015.

Claim 12: Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojana=Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana

Fact: Unclear

The ministry of women and child development’s website does not use the new name–Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojana–for the maternity benefit programme (see the latest release dated May 19, 2017) but archives releases under the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana under the same head.

A senior ministry official was quoted as saying the name had been changed, Hindustan Times reported on May 25, 2017.

Claim 13: Atal Pension Yojana=Swavalamban Yojana

Fact: True

Even as the Modi government folded Congress’s Swavalamban Yojana–a pension scheme for unorganised sector workers launched on September 29, 2010–under its Atal Pension Yojana, the features of the two schemes remain the same, according to this comparison by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute For Contemporary Studies, a think tank in New Delhi.

Claim 14: Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana=Jan Aushadhi scheme

Fact: True

The decision to launch the Jan Aushadhi scheme, a programme to supply unbranded medicines at lower prices, was taken on April 23, 2008. The first store under the scheme was opened on November 25, 2008, according to the Bureau of Pharma PSU in India, established under the department of pharmaceuticals on December 1, 2008, to coordinate the scheme through government-owned companies.

The scheme is now called Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana, according to this Lok Sabha answer on March 14, 2017.

Claim 15: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana=Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme

Fact: False

The 1985 Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme concluded in 1999, according to this report of the agriculture and cooperation department.



Claim 16: Make In India=National Manufacturing Policy

Fact: True

The Make In India website not only summarises the scheme as Congress’s “National Manufacturing Policy” but even the broken download link unsuccessfully directs you to a 2011 document of the older policy.

The features of the National Manufacturing Policy and Make in India remain the same, shows a comparison on Twitter on February 13, 2016, by Amitabh Dubey, a political analyst at Trusted Sources, which provides investment research on emerging markets.


Claim 17: Digital India=National eGovernance Plan

Fact: True

The National eGovernance Plan is “now subsumed under Digital India”, according to this government release on November 30, 2016.

Both the Congress (click here and here) and the BJP schemes talk about building infrastructure for delivering government services electronically.

Claim 18: Skill India=National Skill Development Programme

Fact: True

Previous skill development programmes were relaunched as Skill India with new branding, according to this government release on July 15, 2015.

The older programmes–National Skill Development Corporation and National Skill Development Fund (launched in 2009), and National Skill Development Agency (launched in 2013)–were brought under a new department of skill development and entrepreneurship on July 31, 2014, according to this government release. The department became a ministry on November 9, 2014.

Claim 19: Mission Indradhanush=Universal Immunisation Programme

Fact: True

Mission Indradhanush is the new name for special immunisation weeks, which were being conducted in areas of low immunisation under the Universal Immunisation Programme, FactChecker reported on July 23, 2015.

Claim 20: Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana=National Rural Livelihood Mission

Fact: True

“The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana … is a part of the National Rural Livelihood Mission,” according to the programme website.

Claim 21: PAHAL=Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG

Fact: True

Launched on June 1, 2013, the “Direct Benefit transfer of LPG scheme PAHAL (Pratyaksh Hanstantrit Labh) [was] re-launched in 54 districts on November 15 ,2014 in the 1st phase and will be launched in the rest of the 622 districts of the country on 1.1.2015,” according to this government release on December 31, 2014.

Claim 22: BharatNet=National Optic Fibre Network

Fact: True

The National Optic Fibre Network, approved on October 25, 2011, aims to provide “Broadband connectivity to Panchayats”.

BharatNet merely repeats the claim: “to digitally connect all the Gram Panchayats (GPs) and Villages of India”, according to this September 2016 Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay report on the second phase of the programme.

Claim 23: Sagarmala=National Maritime Development Programme

Fact: False

The programme was originally announced by former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on August 15, 2003, during the BJP-led NDA’s first stint in power, Frontline reported in March-April 2004.

When the Congress-led UPA came to power, it launched its own National Maritime Development Programme even as Sagarmala lapsed, according to this Lok Sabha answer on August 3, 2009.

The NDA revived the original programme on March 25, 2015.

(FactChecker.in is fact-checking initiative, scrutinising for veracity and context statements made by individuals and organisations in public life.)","
On June 15, 2017, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor claimed that 23 new programmes launched by the BJP-led government were essentially renamed versions of schemes introduced by previous Congress-led governments. A detailed fact-check confirmed that 19 of these programmes were indeed rebranded or merged versions of older initiatives. Examples include the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, which evolved from the Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account, and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which was restructured from the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan. Many flagship schemes like Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Digital India, and Make in India have roots in earlier Congress programmes. While some schemes were merely rebranded, others were expanded or combined with new features. A few claims, such as about the crop insurance scheme and Sagarmala project, were found false or unclear. Overall, the analysis highlights the continuity and repackaging of government welfare schemes across different administrations, challenging the BJP's narrative of introducing entirely new programmes.

It could be said that every citizen of India, can justifiably take pride in possessing a rare structure in Mullaperiyar Dam, the very first created in the country, perhaps in the world, for trans-basin diversion of water for beneficial use, towards the end of the 19th century, still continuing to serve with its benefits undiminished, through continuous surveillance, maintenance and management by the Tamil Nadu government.

The credit for the concept, design and construction of the Mullaperiyar Dam should go mainly to two British Engineers Major Ryves, the District Engineer of Madurai District, who gave a practical form in 1862 for diversion of Periyar waters to benefit the drought-prone areas of the then Madurai and Ramanathapuram districts and Colonel J. Pennycuick, who not only made a report with detailed estimates for the Mullaperiyar Dam in 1882 but also ventured against all odds in the most inhospitable dense forest, struggling with single-minded devotion for a good cause and completed the structure in 1895.

Kamat made his mark especially in the Mumbai politics by aggressively focussing on building party organisation to take on saffron Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party. He stuck to Congress party's inclusive politics and never compromised with its principles.
In June 2016 he suddenly announced his decision to quit politics. Even though he was in charge of important states like Gujarat and Rajasthan, he never had a free hand in deciding party matters in the two states. However, he later changed his mind after party president Sonia Gandhi convinced him to stay back.
Kamat again hogged the limelight due to his utterances over the style of functioning of the present city unit president Sanjay Nirupam. He blamed Nirupam for Congress party's fall in BMC polls held in February 2017.

Notwithstanding intra-party rivalry, development of Mumbai was on Kamat's agenda. As a union minister during UPA rule, Kamat was instrumental in pursuing central funding and approval of a slew of infrastructure projects including strengthening of suburban rail services, Metro Rail, Mono Rail and Elevated Railway for the Western and Central Railway. In order to address the city's slum issue, Kamat was at the forefront to increase the size of dwelling units t0 350 sq ft from 250 sq ft under the slums rehabilitation scheme.","Gurudas Kamat, a prominent leader of the Congress party known for his passionate advocacy for Mumbai, passed away. Kamat played a pivotal role in Mumbai politics, focusing on strengthening the Congress organization against rivals like the Shiv Sena and BJP.

The association still managed to reach out to about 15% of the fresh students in the first year of the fee increase. In the last eight years, the Financial Aid Programme (FAP) of the association helped raise over Rs 7.36 crore to benefit 840 students. On Friday, alumnus Ruyintan Mehta donated Rs 1.27 crore to support meritorious students from financially constrained backgrounds.

The implementation of the steep fee hike in 2016 has resulted in an increase in the number of students requiring financial aid, said an alumnus. The association is ensuring that more and more beneficiaries reach out to them to make sure that the fund does not go dry, said the alumnus, who is also a committee member of the FAP. The money raised under the FAP also includes money returned by the beneficiaries of the programme after they graduate from the institute.
The association collaborated with Bengaluru-based Foundation for Excellence to support students. Mehta’s donation was made under this partnership. No student at the institute misses a chance to study due to the non-availability of funds, said a professor.


“It’s a debt we (alumnus) feel towards our alma mater, especially for those of us who move out of the country.

c998fa2fa4c81b3d61fb05803ed51310,"[DOC 1] Famous investment leader Warren Buffett said, “It’s only when the tide goes out that you realise who has been swimming naked”. When the banking system hit rocks, the tide turned and the naked were caught disrobed.
Similarly, sometimes it takes a pitch-black economy to reveal who and what in the financial firmament shines. It is only when darkness falls that one can see stars twinkle. The moonlight coming from an otherwise bleak financial world has been made possible thanks to honest taxpayers, who are transfusing precious blood to bleeding banks.
Undeniably, the current crisis in India’s banking sector has led to calls for privatisation of public sector banks (PSB). However, private banks are no paragons of great virtue. Moreover, faithful advocates of privatization are ill-informed of the real issues. The huge crowds that throng PSBs and put-up with various inconveniences indicate the enormous faith the public has in them.
Consequently, the challenge today does not involve providing ultra-sophisticated banking to 10% upper crust, instead to offer basic financial services to 90% who might not be a great revenue source to banks. Consider, almost all Government pensioners bank exclusively with PSBs.
Pertinently, PSBs have played a big role in financial inclusion and been the Government’s backbone of its socio-economic agenda. Particularly in rural areas, where its role is not confined only to banking, instead it encompasses a holistic developmental agenda being the one-stop shop for the local rural populace’s financial needs including insurance, financial literacy, remittance and receipt of welfare subsidies and grants etc.
The Government’s socio-economic programmes have to use this banking conduit for funds movement. Those who talk of privatisation should visit remote branches of public banks, where managers live at great risk to personal lives, mentoring the locals in financial literacy, technical, business and agricultural literacy.
Remember, PSBs revolutionised rural India during the social banking 1970 era wherein expansion of bank branches was particularly noteworthy. It rose from 8,261 in 1969 to a whopping 65,521 in 2000 and households accessing institutional credit rose from 32% to 61.2% between 1971-1981.
It was this emphasis on those excluded from the formal financial stream which resulted in a slew of measures in finance driving bankers into the battle against poverty. Alas, as we grapple with massive problems confronting struggling masses, ignoble billionaires regularly ride to public troughs.
Politicians are equally guilty of undermining banks integrity. They stack decks with populist sops using banks as spigots for burnishing their election credentials. This is apart from huge loans they forced banks to shovel to their buddies. Shockingly, the proportion of dodgy loans, involving borrowers not making interest payments or repaying principals has surged to highest levels among the world’s largest economies.
Questionably, why should ordinary people bear the burden of fat cats who are gleefully and remorselessly winnowing scarce bank capital? Wherein, the Government gooses these banks with spruced balanced sheets to make them lend again. Ironically, instead of being chastised, industrialists are lauded as captains of industry and adorn glorified positions in industry associations.
India’s pile of soured loans, whose value degrades like an unstable isotope, is a classic example of how powerful and politically influential tycoons undermine rules to secure credit and then default on it. The huge losses posted by banks and desperate attempts by Government to detoxify balance sheets shows how difficult it is for rescue plans to deliver. When borrowers become insolvent, their loans are added to an existing mountain of debt.
Each time this happens, banks have to make heavy write-downs, ploughing dud loans like rotten potatoes, ultimately choking the credit line. To keep these going, the Government regularly keeps injecting capital. Scandalously, 13 PSBs reported combined losses of $8.6 billion this March including $6.5 billion during the last quarter while non-performing loans have surged nearly a fifth from end-December levels.
Most big defaulters have money to employ legal experts who play the judicial system — it is here where law flounders notwithstanding draconian laws which are ineffective against powerful dodgers. New laws are made when existing ones are adequate, needing more teeth for results. We promptly condemn waivers for poor farmers but lack courage to tame big fishes because they have enormous clout.
Banks are aggressive in turning mortgage defaulters on the road whereby indebted farmers commit suicide out of humiliation, salaried class rarely default but are chased for small unpaid debts. But bankers are helpless towards malfeasant promoters of big businesses with scammers and swindlers outfoxing the system.
Bank’s safeguard systems are buttressed by State institutions like regulators, bankruptcy procedures and courts. But what finally underpins security of the whole ecosystem is trust. The RBI no longer is the financial seer it was lionised for insulating the economy from the Lehman 2008 turmoil.
Scams are products of greed and immorality. But abuse of the financial system is because of system’s weaknesses. In an age which heralds technology as the silver bullet, we shouldn’t overlook the most important source of competitive advantage: People as compliance and controls are dependent on them running it. A process is only as good as the people managing it. Consequently, agile auditors will have to struggle to stop managers who are determined to hide their dirty laundry.
The reason for protecting borrowers against creditors is much-reviled moneylenders who loom large on our collective psyche. The scenario is now different: Big borrowers are unlike helpless farmers and lenders not cruel sahukars but public banks. When businessmen default, they rob each one of us taxpayers. In many cases, precious and scarce bank funds are used to finance opulent lifestyles of the rich.
This turmoil calls for improvising risk management models which create an illusory security sense. However, models and machines cannot act as surrogate for human expertise. Money management is no more a genteel world. Bankers will have to bring hard-boiled traders’ instincts to make it secure. Prophetically John Keynes wrote in 1913: “In a country dangerous for banking as India, (it) should be conducted on the safest possible principles”. Our departure from time-honoured metrics has come at a heavy cost.
Today the financial sector is at crossroads wherein its leaders will have to use their financial alchemy to overcome its most challenging moment. Perhaps, Rudyard Kipling’s advice can be guide: “If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, make allowance for their doubting too.” Of course, in the long run, PSBs are not an answer unless there is drastic change in accountability. Else, the people will keep paying for its blunders.
Asserted ex-RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, “A crisis offers us a rare window of opportunity to implement reforms — it is a terrible thing to waste. The temptation will be to over-regulate as we have done in the past. This creates its own perverse dynamic… Perhaps rather than swinging maniacally between too much and too little regulation, it would be better to think of cycle-proof regulation. ” —– INFA","
The article reflects on the ongoing crisis in India's banking sector, particularly the issues faced by public sector banks (PSBs). It emphasizes that the recent crisis, marked by massive non-performing loans and defaults, exposes flaws in the financial system, which have been exacerbated by political interference and corporate greed. While many advocate for the privatization of PSBs, the article argues that these banks play a crucial role in financial inclusion, especially in rural areas, and are vital for executing government socio-economic programs. The crisis highlights systemic weaknesses, with powerful defaulters often escaping accountability while ordinary citizens bear the brunt. The article calls for more robust risk management models and improved accountability in the banking sector, and suggests that the crisis could be an opportunity for meaningful reforms.

Well-known for his gripping jugalbandis with the country's musical greats like Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Jasraj, Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Birju Maharaj and Ustad Zakir Hussain, this Padma Shri-winning tabla player was recently in town. In a conversation with Bangalore Times, Vijay spoke about his passion for the instrument, why he feels the outcome of electronification of music is short-lived and how the city's art-loving audience never fails to impress him...
A Ganga-Yamuna sangam
Bengaluru is the only place in India where the audience appreciates classical music by musicians from the northern part of the country just as much as they love their own Carnatic music. It's like a music junction. Blame it on people's attitude towards music from a different region or a lack of understanding, sometimes it becomes difficult to find good audience for classical music at festivals in the north. But the scene is completely different here. I was, in fact, surprised to see an auditorium full of young spectators at the recent show in the city. Bengalureans know how to accept, acknowledge and appreciate art of every form. For us musicians, music is a universal language that can make us communicate with anyone anywhere.

Presence of classical music in Indian cinemaBollywood is getting way too dependent on electronification of music, leading to numbers that easily escape human memory after a period of time. Multiple sounds are being created by high-end machines, which end up sounding unreal. For instance, one may not remember the song Lungi Dance from Chennai Express for decades to come, but a rerun of yesteryear's hits like Bobby's Hum Tum Ek Kamre Bandh Ho or Jhumka Gira Re from the film Mera Saaya can still make you hum along. Earlier, film music legends like OP Nayyar sahab used to pay a lot of attention to acoustics. That art is dwindling now.


Focus should be on the art, not concertsToday's youngsters are very talented; they get the right amount of exposure too. With learning materials readily available on the internet and music events being conducted even in the remotest of places in the country, there is no dearth for a platform. No doubt the pressure to outshine among the lot can be fierce, but aspiring artistes should stay focused on their art, and not drift away by the lure of public performances and concerts alone.

Love for the tabla

I have been performing from a very young age. What started off as beating empty tin boxes when I was just two-and-a-half years old has stayed on with me as an unbeatable passion to date. Be it accompanying khayal notes or a jazz number, the tabla's versatile music can blend in everywhere.","Pandit Vijay Ghate, a renowned tabla player, shares his insights on classical music, the electronification of Bollywood music, and the importance of focusing on artistic integrity over public performances. He praises Bengaluru's diverse audience and discusses his lifelong passion for the tabla."

Helping Hand Foundation has revealed that 36% students have
poor vision due to refractive errors. The medical condition impacts
their ability to learn as well as not being able to see clearly, which
means the students can’t grasp what is written on the board. Of
the 3,000 studen-ts who participated in the survey, 63.3% or 1,900
pupils had normal vision, while the rest, 1,100, had vision problems.
The survey, covered students of Class I to Class V at mandal
parishad primary schools and Class V to Class X of zilla parishad
high schools, in six villages in Maheshwaram mandal in
Rangareddy district. The survey was done over a span of 30 days
by optometrists and counsellors.
Of the 3000 students surveyed, 1,100 had refractive errors, majority having myopia or near-sightedness (a
common eye condition that makes objects that are far away appear blurry), while the remaining had a condition
called astigmatism, wherein the cornea has a curvature causing blurry vision.
“In both cases, spectacles or contact lenses can correct the condition. It was also observed that many students
are using spectacles irregularly which only compounded the problem. Nearly, 14% of students had other eye
health issues, in which vitamin A deficiency was found in majority of the students. In its more severe forms, vitamin A deficiency contributes to blindne-ss by making the cornea dry, thus damaging the retina and cornea,”
the survey said.
Lack of nutrition, especially dairy products and egg, which are the major source of Vitamin A, was low amongst
children in rural areas.
“Allergic eye disease and conjunctivitis was also found in students. The effective implementation of the breakfast
and mid-day meal programme is essential to curb this problem. Source of dietary Vitamin A must be enhanced
by supplying milk, curd, and egg to students in govt schools. Children must also be provided spectacles and
taught to wear them regularly,” Mujtaba Hasan Askari of Helping Hand Foundation said.
We also published the following articles recently

In recent years, the DFC, once the top-of-the-ticket train, has been criticized as too fast and expensive for the region's capital, not too slow. In 2000, the then government made the decision to reduce the DFC's capital to $14 million from $16 million. The B.C. Liberals won a court case in 2011, claiming that the project was insufficient. A report commissioned by the federal government suggested the DFC was facing shortfalls and falling sales. The Federal Financial Review found there were insufficient capacity to provide sufficient revenue to support the project, despite the support from the federal government. A federal review by former provincial auditors found that while there were $9 billion in ""underwhelming potential"" for the project to be built, the project would still be too expensive to finance. Some of the problems have been exacerbated by the large number of new commercial rail franchises built along the railway line, as well as the need to protect capital investment. The system created in Ottawa was a disaster for the province in its early years, with delays, problems and delays in many aspects of construction, along with higher costs of maintenance and the cost of freight. There are now more than 600 lines of commercial rail currently being built, but the number has not risen enough to cover all of the long-term needs of those lines that are still building. The government spent a year in court arguing that B.C.'s long history of overaccumulation of capital was at risk from falling services even as the province delivered some of its new capital commitments. The government is now back at negotiation with developers to reach a final agreement with a potential commercial line deal. If a deal is reached later this year, more options will be available for those still not receiving financing. Caught in the crossfire with local residents, some city leaders are pushing back against critics of the city's new ""freighttrain"" system, a line they consider ""unworkable.""

The Budget for 2020-21 along with 95 departmental grants were passed by the Assembly without debate. Through supplementary agenda, the government also introduced five bills and they too were passed without debate.
Opposition parties decried the government’s move saying, “The government wants to escape from its accountability towards people and deprive opposition parties of their fundamental right to scrutinise budget and move cut motion.”
Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath countered the opposition charge saying, “The Budget session is confined to passing budget and the government is ready for a debate on the floor of the House on all issues.”
“Before pointing fingers at the government, the opposition should do some introspection and look up the record of the sessions of Assembly of the last 15 years when they were in power’’, the CM said.
“Like the three special sessions in 2019, I wish the Assembly will hold similar special sessions this year to in which different issues concerning the people will be taken up and all members will participate. We should take cue from traditions of parliamentary committees and make collective efforts to enrich the proceedings of the Assembly,” Yogi said.
Pointing to leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, who was wearing a medical mask, Chief Minister said, “He can wear a mask but should not put cotton in his ears.”
Despite committing to participate, Chaudhary had boycotted the special session to commemorate the 150 birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi wherein sustainable development goals were discussed, a decision which he later regretted.
Yogi repeatedly teased the leader of opposition to remove the mask and speak on the issue of hike in MLA Local Area Development Fund and other issues, but Chaudhary refused to bite the bait. 
Yogi said, “The leader of the opposition is against the hike in Vidhayak Nidhi. I wish there was a House committee to work out all issues related to utilisation of funds from Vidhayak Nidhi.”
On Thursday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna had said that there was no move to curtail the Budget session and the session would continue till March 7, as per the agenda approved by Business Advisory Committee of the House. 
While Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress members staged a noisy walkout from the House over the adamant stance of the government, principle opposition Samajwadi Party members kept sitting while wearing medical masks, depicting that their voices had been gagged.

a214d0da559252e457055f5a6d9de9cf,"[DOC 1] Saudi Arabia on Monday said it will raise its oil exports to a record 10.6 million barrels per day starting from May, escalating a price war with Russia.

Oil prices are languishing at 17-year lows as the coronavirus pandemic threatens a global recession that will send demand plummeting.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, which already announced a sharp production increase for April, said it will add additional supplies to the global market, deepening a glut. “The kingdom plans to raise its petroleum exports by 600,000 bpd from May, so total exports will increase to 10.6 million bpd,” said an official at the energy ministry, cited by the state-run SPA agency.

Saudi Arabia had been exporting around 7.0 million bpd under an output reduction agreement among a 24-member producers’ alliance known as OPEC+ which included Russia.

Its Gulf neighbour UAE has also pledged to pump at least one million bpd more from next month.

Riyadh said earlier this month it was raising exports to 10 million bpd in April after a production cut agreement among top producers flopped in early March.

OPEC+ failed to reach an agreement on further production cuts to shore up sagging prices as the coronavirus hit the global economy hard. In an effort to grab market share, Saudi Arabia immediately announced a substantial increase in its production to 12.3 million bpd and exports to 10 million bpd at the beginning of April.

The energy ministry said it will secure the increase from two sources, by using natural gas in the domestic market to free up oil for export and also as domestic consumption drops because of the coronavirus.","Saudi Arabia announced it will raise its oil exports to a record 10.6 million barrels per day (bpd) starting in May, escalating a price war with Russia amid the global oil market slump. This increase of 600,000 bpd follows a previous plan to raise exports to 10 million bpd in April. The move comes after a breakdown in the OPEC+ agreement, which includes Russia, over production cuts due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Saudi Arabia aims to secure this increase by using natural gas domestically and reducing domestic oil consumption as a result of the crisis. The country's decision intensifies a glut in the market, exacerbating the downward pressure on oil prices, which have hit 17-year lows."
9fd1cd56399ffa2c76b76df96d9f14d5,"[DOC 1] The armed forces have signed contracts with Indian defence companies and startups under the fast-track process for acquisition of new-age weapons, according to people aware of development, a move that will see home-grown systems speedily delivered to the frontline. The contracts were signed last week.

The army has placed its first-ever order for swarm drone systems which are capable of surveillance and attack missions, cutting-edge loitering munitions that are being made in India, and drones capable of carrying loads to high altitudes, the people cited earlier said.

The air force has signed up for a mobile anti-drone system while the navy will get a similar system for its warships. Processed under the fast-track procedure, all the contracts have been placed on domestic companies as part of the ‘Make in India’ initiative, and will be delivered within a year, according to the sources.

The army has taken the lead in swarm drones–considered as the future of warfare–by placing a Rs 200-cr order on Indian startups to supply a system capable of surveillance, electronic warfare and kinetic attack. Bengaluru-based startup NewSpace Research and Tech has been selected for the contract, the sources said.

NewSpace Research is also working with Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. for a futuristic air-launched swarm drone system, called Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), which envisages a manned aircraft capable of launching multiple drones to carry out high-risk missions, including taking down of enemy air defences.

Another startup, Noida-based Raphe mPhibr, has been awarded a contract for swarm drones as well as a load carrying unmanned aerial vehicle that can be used to supply essentials to troops at difficult locations.

While the air force is also looking at swarm drones, the army has taken the lead to order the system, catching up with similar efforts in the US, UK, Russia and China to use multiple drones for carrying out coordinated military missions.

The army has also ordered its first domestically produced loitering munitions–medium-sized UAVs fitted with an explosive warhead that home into a target in a suicide mission.

The`100-crore contract for 125 of the loitering munitions has been placed with Alpha Design Technologies, which will make them at its Bengaluru-based facility in partnership with Elbit of Israel, the sources said.

Given their low cost, these systems are capable of disproportionate damage in the battlefield. Alpha, which already has been producing the weapons at Bengaluru for export, is confident of delivering all 125 systems within 12 months to the army. According to the sources, the IAF has placed orders with Hyderabad-based Zen Tech for a mobile anti-drone system.","The Indian Armed Forces (IAF) have signed contracts with Indian defence companies and startups under a fast-track process for the acquisition of new-age weapons.

5726ae2a935414dd608c2ae2f1dab5f3,"[DOC 1] When and why do people protest? Why do they protest over some issues but not others? These questions have come up since the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was enacted and the possibility of an all-India National Register of Citizens (NRC). The persistence of protests against the CAA and NRC and its spread nationwide have surprised people.


While some are surprised, others are angry at protesters, labelling them anti-national or unpatriotic. Many online fora quickly degenerate into calls to “go to Pakistan"" if one expresses any dissatisfaction with the government. They suggest that if one is in India, one must have chosen it over other countries, leaping to the conclusion that because one has not left, everything is alright under the Indian government.

The late Albert O. Hirschman described this dichotomy between an exit and a voice in his famous book, Exit, Voice, And Loyalty: Responses To Decline In Firms, Organizations, And States. He argued that when individuals are dissatisfied with any organization, whether it is the state, place of work, or a business, they essentially have two options: either to exit the organization, or to voice one’s complaint in the hope of improving matters.


The exercise of the exit option is determined by other available substitutes. In competitive markets, dropping products sold by one business for another imposes very low costs. If an employer creates a bad working environment, employees can and do leave. On the other hand, when there are few substitutes, and exit is costly, individuals choose to use their voice—to criticize, protest and change the existing organization.

In the context of the state, there are different levels of state functions at which individuals choose between using their voice and making an exit. Given the abysmal state of public goods, Indians at every income level often find it better to exit state provisions. Despite an increase in our school-going population, public school enrolment has actually fallen by 11.1 million, while enrolments in private schools rose by 16 million between 2010-11 and 2014-15. When government schools are of poor quality, even low-income families exit the school system and send their children to budget private schools. Both slums and posh housing communities have moved to privately supplied water and garbage collection services. Firms and job seekers relocate to better governed areas, resulting in interstate migration. The highest level is emigration to another country, a complete exit from the nation state. But this imposes very high costs, and emigration is not an option for most, especially for minor grievances.","The passage discusses how people react to dissatisfaction with a government, drawing on Albert Hirschman's idea of exit and voice.

* **Exit:** Leaving the situation (e.g., emigrating, using private schools). This is common when there are good alternatives (e.g., good schools in other countries).

“We have arrested Dhiren Singh, who is a resident of Assam. Thirty rounds of cartridges were recovered from him,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Task Force), Bastav Baidya told The Hindu . He was arrested from the Maidan area of the city.

Mr. Baidya, however, refused to give more details on the arrest.

Police sources said Singh came here to establish links with members of the Communist Party of India (Maoist).

According to reports, the group, with the help of the Maoists, was trying to spread its base in the northeast and West Bengal.

The accused was produced in a city court and was remanded in police custody till February 16.

Intelligence inputs available with the security agencies indicate that the United Liberation Front of Assam has planned a series of major strikes with the help of the Manipur-based PLA and the Maoists.","Kolkata Police's Special Task Force arrested Dhiren Singh, an alleged member of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), a Manipur-based extremist group.

26eb8aaab209f285dee001baf41bc5df,"[DOC 1] In a recent order, the Bombay High Court voiced serious concerns about the increasing suicide rates, especially among students. This serves as a reminder of an issue that is going unnoticed in our society. This is more than a statement; it’s a reflection of the serious mental health pandemic we are now experiencing.

As a psychiatrist practising in the city, I have personally observed the catastrophic effects of suicide. The causes of suicide are complex and wide-ranging. Common explanations include relationship issues, fear of failing, financial troubles, pressure to perform well academically, and other mental health disorders. Social media’s display of flawless lifestyles has already worsened emotions of loneliness and inadequacy. It is essential that one understands that, despite how overwhelming life feels at times, suicide is not an option.

Suicide prevention is not an issue that can be solved in a day. It calls for a comprehensive strategy. I believe there should be easy access to counselling sessions for students. Often people go through a lot of problems, which they do not talk about. It is important for family and friends to identify potential people who could be moving towards becoming suicidal due to some serious problems in life.

Seeking professional help for ourselves or a loved one is a brave step towards a healing journey and should not be considered a weakness. It is important for people to speak about what is bothering them without fear of being judged. Developing resilience is very important, which could include helping them with coping mechanisms or helping people out with their problem-solving strategies while having a positive attitude.

One common misconception amongst people is that talking about suicides and mental health may implant ideas in a person’s mind, which is not true. In reality conversations on such topics can save lives. We should always be kind to people around us, as it may help us to identify the affected people. We never know what battles a person could be going through and in what ways our words or actions could affect them. We should always remember that in today’s time, help is easily accessible, whether offline or online. It is important to gather courage and seek out help when required.

Educating people about mental health awareness on social media is something that has been going on for a while and should be promoted even more so that people can come out and seek help. The use of technology can also be beneficial. Essentially, the best way to prevent suicide is to increase awareness about it and inculcate a feeling of security, happiness, optimism, and positivity among people going through tough times – emotionally or otherwise.","The Bombay High Court has raised concerns about rising suicide rates among students, highlighting a significant mental health crisis. As a psychiatrist, I’ve witnessed the devastating impact of suicide, which often stems from issues such as relationship problems, academic pressure, and financial stress. Social media exacerbates feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. Preventing suicide requires a multifaceted approach, including accessible counseling, family and friend support, and professional help. It’s crucial to discuss mental health openly, as it can save lives and reduce stigma. Promoting mental health awareness and leveraging technology can provide vital support and foster resilience."

Their last two victories, against South Africa and Sri Lanka, have been by 243 runs and 302 runs, margins so emphatic that to call them contests would seem disingenuous. Virat Kohli is equaling records you once thought were immortal. Rohit Sharma is batting and leading as if he can do no wrong. Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami are world class. Mohammed Siraj makes vital breakthroughs.
Ravindra Jadeja is paying tribute to the late Bishan Singh Bedi by conjuring deliveries to right-handers that land on middle stump and hit off. Kuldeep Yadav, India’s highest wicket-taker in ODIs this year and capable of bowling rippers like the one to Jos Buttler a week ago, has been barely needed in the last two games.
They are doing all this in an understated manner that makes them likeable too – a trait hard to attain when you are winning all the time.","In the age of social media, consumed by the search for instant gratification and the tendency to offer definitive verdicts, it’s of little surprise that India’s current run is immediately inviting lofty parallels by experts and fans alike. Are they among the best one-day teams India have ever had? Can they be as ruthless as the Australians who won without losing a game in 2003 and 2007?
The present bunch has all the makings of a great team, but grand pronouncements, if at all necessary, are best delivered at the end of a World Cup. The players will prefer it that way, for they know their standing will pivot on how they fare in the week following the final game of the preliminary phase against Netherlands on November 12."

""The education system should act as a facilitator, not a barrier, to learning. It must serve as a tool to empower students rather than functioning solely as a regulator. The role of regulation in education should focus on streamlining processes and ensuring smooth functioning, rather than enforcing rigid 'dos and don'ts' that can stifle the experimental spirit among students,"" he said.
Hailing the National Education Policy (NEP), the RSS chief said it may have been introduced recently, but discussions to have such a kind of system have been underway for many years, adding that several schools have been imparting ""value-based"" education for long.
The new education system will be implemented completely, and it will lead the country to the desired dream, he said.
""We need to change ourselves according to the times, but while doing so, we must ensure that we are rooted in our basic foundational values. While sticking to those eternal foundational values, we need to lead ahead and face the future. We need to juxtapose the modern and ancient, for which all must contribute,"" he opined.

Many truck drivers have joined the strike that has been called to press for the revocation of new provisions and are holding protests. There is also a rush on petrol pumps as people fear the stir will impede fuel supply.

Police faced resistance by protesting truck drivers and locals in the Bandanwada area of Kekri district on Monday night when they tried to clear the road.

“The police had gone to clear a traffic jam on Ajmer-Bhilwara highway when the mob pelted stones at the police, leaving three policemen injured. A vehicle of Kekri city police station was also burnt,” Circle Officer of Kekri Sanjay Singh said.

He said that additional policemen were deployed in the area and the road was cleared.
“Efforts are being made to identify those involved in the incident,” he said, adding that there is no jam today.

Satish Jain, President of Jaipur Transport Operators Association, said that nearly 80 per cent of the truck drivers have boycotted work in protest against the law.

The truck drivers are not working and they are participating in the strike which has affected the transportation of goods. Transporters are also standing by the drivers,” Jain said.

“We demand that the government review the provisions of the law which are harsh and not practical to fulfill,” he said.

Rajendra Singh Bhati, president of the petrol pump dealers association, said that supply has been affected by nearly 20 per cent in the state due to the truckers’ strike.

Under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), which replaced the colonial era Indian Penal Code, drivers who cause a serious road accident by negligent driving and run away without informing the police or any official from the administration can face a punishment of up to 10 years or a fine of Rs 7 lakh.

06b1ef119ffe810f05d5f0923cca8863,"[DOC 1] ONE turning-point in the India-Pakistan summit at Agra was Gen Pervez Musharraf's breakfast meeting with certain Delhi-centric editors picked up at random. This was a calculated move on the part of Pakistan's media managers to catch the eyes and ears of the public in the subcontinent and beyond and project their new ruler as a tough person.

Indeed, the General gave the impression as if he was talking to his commanders and not India's ""thinking persons"" who might not have relished what he ""sold"" them as ""truth"" on Kashmir.

Such breakfast meetings are part of interactive diplomacy these days. However, decorum demands that these interactions are kept off the record.

At the Monday morning encounter President Musharraf first read out his written statement and then invited questions.

This was aggressive PR. The Pakistan President's idiom was neither friendly nor positive. This went against the very spirit and purpose of the Agra summit for establishing peace, amity and cooperation between the two neighbours. India's External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh politely hammered this point during his press conference at the Media Centre (Mughal Sheraton) at Agra the next day.

The on-the-record breakfast interaction at the critical stage of the summit deliberations showed Islamabad's insensitivity to diplomatic niceties. It is a different matter if the purpose was to wreck the dialogue.

If the General meant business and was serious about negotiations, he should have avoided this televised show. Informal discussions with senior Indian journalists would, of course, have been very much in order. But President Musharraf wanted to play to the gallery to score a few points.

General Musharraf is surely entitled to air his views. In this country opinions and viewpoints float freely, howsoever loathsome these might be to the powers that be.

What has, however, disturbed me is the distortion of certain historical facts and the selective play of certain past events. This was reflected in the General's response to some pointed, some insipid and some goody-goody questions from the editors.

It must be said to his credit that General Musharraf used the occasion intelligently to highlight his perspective on Kashmir.

Perhaps, some senior journalists would have loved to join issue, if given a chance. Such occasions are generally not meant to be debating forums.

Still, a bit of soul-searching by General Musharraf may help. I firmly believe that stable ties between the two countries can be built if we are honest and true to ourselves as well as to one another. Here duplicity and the diplomacy of back-stabbing can hardly show a new direction.

General Musharraf speaks for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. He points out that without a solution to the question of Kashmir, Indo-Pak relations cannot be improved; nor can other bilateral problems be discussed or sorted out.

Fine. May I ask the General: who has given Pakistan ""the authority"" (thekedari) to speak for the people of Jammu and Kashmir? The Pakistan-sponsored Hurriyat card represents only one section of the state.

Does President Musharraf possess a copy of the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir?

Is it not a fact that with the signing of the Instrument of Accession by Maharaja Hari Singh Jammu and Kashmir became part of India? This was later endorsed by Sheikh Abdullah, then popular leader of the state.

Even if we grant the General this ""privilege"", tomorrow he may claim to speak for over 130 million Muslim citizens of this country who outnumber the Pakistanis.

We do not see the country's composite problems with communal angularities. To say that is not to deny occasional distortions, mistakes, political games and vote bank politics often played by politicians. Still, this nation has enough resilience to withstand such onslaughts and apply correctives. This is the strength of Indian democracy.

It will be worthwhile for General Musharraf to recheck his facts so that he does not see freedom fighters in terrorists! As for the Palestinians, their's is a different saga of bravery and struggle. So was the case with Mukti Bahini. The General will have to read certain authentic accounts to find out the genesis of the crisis in the erstwhile East Pakistan that led to India coming into the picture. In any case, we cannot improve the atmosphere by retailoring the subcontinent's history to suit the whims and fancies of Pakistani leaders.

India has not kept Bangladesh as its colony. It is a free and independent country — a proud member of the comity of nations. In sharp contrast, the Kashmiris know Islamabad's gameplan to make it a colony of Pakistan in the name of Islam and Muslim solidarity!

It is also an internationally known fact that Pakistan has been aiding and abetting terrorism and disturbing the peace and tranquillity in the valley.

Islamabad has training camps for terrorists across the border and within its territory. A similar dubious game was played by the ISI for Punjab militants. Documentary proof is available in this regard.

May I also ask the General: why is he running these camps if he is keen on solving the Kashmir problem? Why is he openly supporting militants who are killing civilians the most?

To General Musharraf, Kashmir is a ""core issue"". By the way, no Pakistani talks of ""Jammu and Kashmir"", but only of ""Kashmir"". Is there a hidden meaning in this? Afterall, they know that the Hindus of Jammu and the Buddhists of Ladakh will not join Pakistan. They must also know that few people in the valley have any love lost for Islamabad.

Well, Jammu and Kashmir is a core issue for India, too. India cannot accept Pakistan's claim on J&K for a number of reasons:

First, partition of India did not take place on the basis of the two-nation theory. India rejected it. In any case, more than a hundred million Muslims chose to remain in India and refused to go to the other side. So did the Muslims of Jammu and Kashmir. They chose to remain with India.

Second, partition was not a geographical division.

What then was the basis of Pakistan? Muslim majority states contiguous to each other were to form the new state of Pakistan. As for the princely states, they were to join India or Pakistan according to geographical contiguity. The final choice was left to the Maharajas. In no case was independence an option.

Jammu and Kashmir is contiguous to both India and Pakistan. So, the Maharaja's choice became vital and decisive. This was as simple as that.

What led to the problem of Jammu and Kashmir was the Anglo-American gameplan to keep the state with Pakistan so that they could gain access to it for setting up watchposts against the then Soviet Union and China. We know what happened as a consequence.

It was wrong on the part of Jawaharlal Nehru to go to the UN. But worse was his plebiscite line which was subject to certain conditions. Let us assume that a plebiscite was held and Kashmiri Muslims voted for accession to Pakistan. (Of course, such a prospect was unthinkable.)

What would have happened? There would have been an exodus of Hindus and Sikhs and Buddhists from the state. They would have either been driven out of the state or they would have fled out of fear for their lives.

Nehru was a witness to the partition holocaust. Remember, Pakistan was after the entire state. If Pakistan's claim was reduced to part of the valley, history would have taken a different course.

Pakistan says today that Jammu and Kashmir is not a territorial question, but a human rights issue — the issue of self-determination. The UN does not recognise this right if it leads to secessionism. Even otherwise, the UN Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, has said categorically the UN resolution is no longer applicable to Kashmir. So, what is the locus standi of Islamabad?

So the issue boils down to the valley people. From all indications, the people of the valley do not want to join Pakistan. But while Islamabad talks of the ideal of self-determination, it is unwilling to accept the same right for Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) and the northern territories.

As it is, out of the total area of the present day Jammu and Kashmir, about 35 per cent is under illegal occupation of Pakistan, about 2 per cent has been handed over by it to China, which is already in illegal occupation of an additional area of about 17 per cent. The means that the area under the effective control of the state is roughly 46 per cent.

Be that as it may. How can Pakistan justify the proxy war, its enormous casualties and all the money wasted on this? Did it hope to grab the whole state and drive out the Hindus and the Buddhists? Pakistan-sponsored militants have already thrown out the Kashmiri Pandits from the valley as part of their cleansing politics.

This is what one is led to believe from Pakistan's reluctance to include cross-border terrorism in the proposed joint statement at Agra.

Islamabad should know that the proxy war must be wound up if the dialogue is to continue and give meaningful results. This is the test of Islamabad's sincerity.

As for economic cooperation, the gas pipeline project is central. It is beneficial to both Pakistan and India, as also to Iran. But it cannot wait indefinitely. If Iran and India take a decision to try the sea-bed route, then Pakistan will be out of the picture for now and forever. That is the price it will have to pay for its procrastination. It will also have repercussions on US-Pakistan relations.

The point I want to make is this: the anti-India animus will put Pakistan on a disastrous course. One cannot even envisage where it will end.

On the other hand, a positive and constructive approach could be the dawn of a new era in India-Pakistan relations. The choice is Pakistan's. It needs to look beyond Agra","The Agra summit revealed Pakistan's aggressive PR tactics and its reluctance to acknowledge cross-border terrorism. India countered with historical facts and emphasized Kashmir's integral part of India. Pakistan's proxy war must cease for dialogue to progress. Economic cooperation, like the gas pipeline, requires urgency. The ball is in Pakistan's court for positive change."

businessman Massad Boulos would serve as senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern
affairs.Mr. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social. Mr. Boulos, the father-in-law of
Trump's daughter Tiffany, met repeatedly with Arab American and Muslim leaders during
the election campaign.
It was the second time in recent days that Mr. Trump chose the father-in-law of one of his
children to serve in his administration.
On Saturday, Mr. Trump said that he had picked his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, real
estate mogul Charles Kushner, to serve as U.S. ambassador to France.
Boulos’ ties with both Lebanon and U.S
In recent months, Mr. Boulos campaigned for Mr. Trump to drum up Lebanese and Arab
American support, even as the U.S.-backed Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah in
Lebanon.
Mr. Boulos has powerful roots in both countries.
His father and grandfather were both figures in Lebanese politics and his father-in-law
was a key funder of the Free Patriotic Movement, a Christian party aligned with Hezbollah.
His son Michael and Tiffany Trump were married in an elaborate ceremony at Trump's
Florida Mar-a-Lago Club in November 2022, after getting engaged in the White House Rose
Garden during Trump's first term.
Mr. Boulos has been in touch with interlocutors across Lebanon's multipolar political
world, three sources who spoke to him in recent months say, a rare feat in Lebanon, where
decades-old rivalries between factions run deep.
Particularly notable is his ability to maintain relations with Hezbollah, they say. The
Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim party has a large number of seats in Lebanon's parliament
and ministers in the government.
Mr. Boulos is a friend of Suleiman Frangieh, a Christian ally of Hezbollah and its candidate
for Lebanon's presidency. He is also in touch with the Lebanese Forces Party, a vehemently
anti-Hezbollah Christian faction, the sources say, and has ties to independent lawmakers
Aron Lund, fellow at the Century Foundation think tank, said Boulos was well placed to
influence Trump's Middle East policy after playing a small but significant role in
expanding Trump's appeal to Arab American and Muslim voters during the campaign.
""Boulos' Lebanese political past gives no real indication of a geostrategic or even national
vision, but it demonstrates ambition and a set of political allies that will stand out in
Trump's circle like a sore thumb,"" Lund wrote.
Boulos’ business ties
Boulos, a billionaire with extensive business ties in Nigeria, was born in Lebanon, but
moved to Texas as a teenager, where he attended the University of Houston, earned a law
degree and became a U.S. citizen.
His son and Trump's daughter, whose mother is Trump's second wife Marla Maples, met
on the Greek island of Mykonos, at actor Lindsay Lohan's club, People Magazine reported
in 2022.
Trump's election win in Michigan came in part because of Boulos' help flipping some of
the 300,000 Arab Americans and Muslims in the state who overwhelmingly supported
Biden in 2020 but opposed Biden's policies in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon, Trump campaign
officials and supporters told Reuters.
""Boulos played a big role in the outreach to Muslim voters,"" said Rabiul Chowdhury, cofounder of Muslims for Trump.
Beginning in September, the Trump campaign held weekly meetings in person and via
Zoom with dozens of Arab American and Muslim civic leaders and business executives.
Mr. Boulos spent weeks on the ground in Michigan, Pennsylvania and other states with
big Arab American and Muslim populations, assuring audiences in private lunches and
dinners that tapped his own connections to Lebanese American businessmen that Trump
was committed to ending the wars in the Middle East.
Responsible for mobilising Arab American and Muslim voters.The Trump campaign spent tens of millions of dollars on the effort to mobilize Arab
American and Muslim voters, Boulos told Reuters in an interview shortly after the
election.
Mr. Trump won endorsements from Muslim imams and the Muslim mayor of Hamtramck,
another town near Detroit with a large Arab American population, as well as the large
Bangladeshi community, and courted Iraqi Americans, Albanian Americans and others.
While the events on the ground in Lebanon played a factor, the economy did too. And
conservative Arabs and Muslims were concerned about what they saw as the Democrats'
""far left ideology,"" including support of transgender rights, Mr. Boulos said","
On December 1, 2024, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced that Lebanese-American businessman Massad Boulos would serve as senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Boulos, who is married to Trump's daughter Tiffany, played a key role in building support among Arab American and Muslim voters during Trump's campaign. Boulos has significant ties to both Lebanon and the U.S., with his family involved in Lebanese politics and his own business interests in Nigeria. He has maintained relations with diverse political factions in Lebanon, including Hezbollah and the anti-Hezbollah Lebanese Forces Party. His outreach efforts helped Trump win endorsements from Muslim and Arab American communities, particularly in Michigan, and mobilized support based on concerns over Middle Eastern policy and social issues. Boulos' extensive network and influence among Arab American voters are seen as significant in shaping Trump's Middle East policy."
e06e872865b4c83934265d8b65459fd8,"[DOC 1] Coming to the rescue of Manmohan Singh, Congress on Sunday described Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as an “anti-national” for belittling the Prime Minister over the ‘village woman’ controversy and demanded an apology to the nation.

Strongly condemning Modi for the remarks, Congress said it does not suit a Prime Ministerial candidate to use such fowl language against the Prime Minister. Addressing an election rally in Delhi, Modi said that Sharif had referred to Singh as a “village woman” during an interaction where Indian scribes were also present.

“How dare you (Sharif) address my nation’s Prime Minister as a village womanIJ There cannot be a bigger insult of the Indian Prime Minister. We can fight with him on policies but this will not be tolerated. The PM heads 1.2 billion people who will not stand by such remarks,” he said.

Reacting to Modi’s barbs, head of the Congress media department, Ajay Maken told reporters, “It is anti-national and needs to be strongly condemned. He needs to apologise to the nation for saying something that puts our Prime Minister in poor light.”

Maken commented on the views of a Pakistani journalist who claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has termed Singh as a “village woman” for complaining against him before US President Barack Obama.

He said, “Modi, who claims to be a nationalist, does not believe in the Indian journalists and spreads a false story of a Pakistani journalist before the whole nation,” he said, adding “Modi has put forth Pakistan’s views before the nation”.

Maken said it is “very sad that Modi chose a time to show the Prime Minister in poor light when he is abroad.” Another Congress leader Rashid Alvi dismissed Modi’s charge that Rahul Gandhi had undermined the PM’s authority by attacking the ordinance on lawmakers and alleged that the Gujarat CM was “misguiding” the country while “ignoring” his State which is facing a flood threat.

“Rahul Gandhi had not even mentioned the name of the Prime Minister. He had only expressed his views regarding the ordinance. He did not even ask the Government to withdraw it,” Alvi said, alleging that it was Modi who was “denigrating” the PM.

“look at the content and tone in which he spoke. I think it is utterly despicable,” said another party leader Sandeep Dikshit. Earlier in the day, in a scathing attack on Gandhi, Modi accused him of undermining authority of the Prime Minister and asked people to decide if the nation will be run according to the constitution or whims of the “prince”.

","Congress criticized Gujarat CM Narendra Modi, calling him ""anti-national"" for his remarks belittling PM Manmohan Singh over a controversy with Nawaz Sharif. Modi's comments were condemned as disrespectful, with Congress demanding an apology for demeaning the PM and accused Modi of misrepresenting facts to the nation.

528b91edfea710b95d43fdb65d8ed466,"[DOC 1] Tel Aviv, June 19 (IANS) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the world leaders have expressed admiration for the determination and accomplishments of the Israeli forces.

The escalating conflict between both nations began last Friday when Netanyahu announced the launch of 'Operation Rising Lion' against Iran, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat of nuclear weapons.

This action prompted swift and aggressive retaliation from Tehran, pushing the region closer to the brink of a broader war.

""I must tell you that I speak with world leaders, and they are very impressed by our determination and the achievements of our forces. They are also greatly impressed by you, citizens of Israel, by your strong spirit and by your steadfastness,"" said Netanyahu, addressing the nation on Wednesday.

Appreciating the US President Donald Trump for the support, the Israeli PM said, ""I thank President Donald Trump, a great friend of Israel, for standing alongside us, and for the support of the US in assisting in defending the skies over Israel. We speak frequently, including last night. We had a very warm conversation. I thank Trump for his backing.""

Netanyahu asserted that the Operation Rising Lion campaign against Iran was aimed at removing two existential threats to Israel, that are the nuclear threat and the ballistic missile threat.

He noted that Israel is advancing step by step to remove these threats.

""We control the skies over Tehran. We are striking the ayatollahs' regime with great force. We are attacking nuclear installations, missiles, command centres and the symbols of the regime,"" he stated

""We are sustaining many losses, painful losses. But we see that the home front is strong. The people are strong, and the State of Israel is stronger than ever. I have directed the Government ministries to assist all those who have been harmed,"" the Israeli PM further added.

Netanyahu also mentioned that ""intense fighting"" in the Gaza Strip is continuing, adding that Israel will not relent and is committed to achieving the two tasks -- ""defeating Hamas and returning all of our hostages, living and deceased.""

""To my regret, in recent days as well, heroic soldiers have fallen. I share in the families' sorrow. We send condolences on behalf of the Government and the entire nation. We embrace them. We will continue until we bring them all and until Hamas is finally defeated,"" he further added.","Netanyahu Claims Global Support as Israel-Iran Conflict Escalates
Key Developments:
1️⃣ World Leaders’ Admiration: Netanyahu stated that international leaders have praised Israel’s military resolve and civilian resilience amid ongoing strikes on Iran.
2️⃣ U.S. Backing: Thanked President Trump for defensive support, including air defense coordination.
3️⃣ Operation Rising Lion:

Objectives: Neutralize Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile threats.

Progress: Claims Israel now ""controls skies over Tehran"", striking nuclear sites, missile depots, and regime targets.
4️⃣ Gaza War Continues: Vowed to defeat Hamas and secure hostage returns, despite mounting military casualties.

Strategic Context:

Global Diplomacy: Netanyahu’s remarks aim to solidify Western support as regional tensions risk spiraling.

Domestic Messaging: Highlights national unity while acknowledging ""painful losses"" to maintain public morale.

Dual-Front War: Simultaneous operations against Iran and Hamas stretch IDF resources, testing long-term sustainability.

Why It Matters:

8fa56dcca5eb994fa12fbb58e45a5087,"[DOC 1]  In the case of a liquid fund, what is the current rate of dividend distribution tax? My CA tells me it is higher than that applicable to other debt-based schemes. Would the tax be different in case I invest in MIP of any mutual fund and opt for regular monthly dividends? — Manoj

A : Your CA is correct. The distribution tax in the case of liquid funds is higher at 25% as compared to other debt-based funds. Other debt-based funds such as income funds or MIP have a lower distribution tax of 12.5%. Nowadays, mutual funds have introduced liquid plus funds that are for all practical purposes like liquid funds, however, the distribution tax rate on these funds is the lower rate of 12.5%. You may choose to invest in liquid-plus funds, instead of MIPs as MIPs have an element of equity component that increases their risk.

PMS tax

Q: My query is regarding the tax rules applicable on gains from PMS (Portfolio Management Schemes). Does the amount of tax be decided when we redeem the PMS? Or do we pay STCG / LTCG tax based on the churning of portfolio by the PMS Manager? Is the tax rate as applicable to equity oriented mutual funds? — Ravindra

A: In the case of a Portfolio Management Scheme, the company that manages the portfolios (referred to hereinafter as the Portfolio Manager) undertakes transactions on behalf of its clients. Consequently, the Portfolio Manager merely acts in a fiduciary capacity with regard to the client's funds and all rights, liabilities and obligations relating to securities transactions are essentially that of the client. For this service, the Portfolio Manager charges an agreed fee to the clients for rendering portfolio management services. The rates of tax depend upon the view taken by the authorities as to whether this is a business or investment activity of the investor. We strongly feel that this should be construed to be investment and hence be liable to the capital gains tax system. However, the ITO may in view of the frequent number of transactions that typically arise from portfolio management, classify this activity as trading activity and classify the income from as trading income.","### Dividend Distribution Tax on Liquid Funds vs. Other Debt-Based Schemes

For liquid funds, the current rate of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) is 25%, which is higher compared to other debt-based schemes such as income funds or Monthly Income Plans (MIPs), where the DDT is 12.5%. Liquid-plus funds, which are similar to liquid funds but classified differently, also have a lower DDT of 12.5%. If minimizing tax is a concern, liquid-plus funds might be a preferable option over MIPs, which carry some equity risk.

### Tax on Gains from Portfolio Management Schemes (PMS)

For Portfolio Management Schemes (PMS), taxes on gains are generally assessed based on whether the activity is classified as business or investment. Typically, PMS activities are treated as investment activities, subject to capital gains tax (STCG or LTCG) upon redemption of the PMS. However, if the transactions within the PMS are frequent and considered trading activity, they might be classified as business income by the Income Tax Officer (ITO), leading to tax under the trading income category."

The state government on Thursday said a special drive will be rolled out to address the issues that have deprived nearly nine lakh farmers in the state from the centrally sponsored Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Yojana.

Under the scheme, announced February 1 last year, every eligible farmer would receive Rs 6,000 per year as income support from the Centre, to be credited in three instalments of Rs 2,000 each. In Maharashtra, over 91 lakh farmers have benefitted from the scheme, when around nine lakh farmers were left out.

On Thursday, state Agriculture Minister Dadasaheb Bhuse said, “Under the PMKSY 91.13 lakh farmers have been beneficiaries. The amount has been directly credited in their bank accounts. However, there are still a large number of farmers who have not been registered under the scheme. We will launch a drive, till August 5, to find out what went wrong. If there was any technical error or otherwise, it would be rectified to bring the farmers under (the ambit of the) scheme.”

Bhuse, however, expressed satisfaction over the progress made under the scheme. “There are 1.52 crore farmers in Maharashtra. Of them, 91.13 lakh have registered and availed the benefit under PMKSY,” he said.

The total amount credited in 91.13 lakh farmers in five instalments for 2019 and 2020 is Rs 6,949 crore, Bhuse said.

""Investigation was going on in the matter with utmost seriousness. The chargesheet in the matter was filed on October 7 against accused Sanjay Roy and a Sealdah court has taken cognisance,"" he told the bench.

The top court observed that the CBI report indicated that the agency was probing the role of other persons as a part of its ongoing investigation and sought a further status report within three weeks.
On the issue of the National Task Force (NTF), constituted to make recommendations over the safety and security of medical professionals, the apex court noted that it had held no meeting since the first week of September. The apex court, therefore, directed the Centre to take proactive steps to ensure that the work was completed within a reasonable period of time.

""The meetings of the NTF should happen periodically and all sub groups should hold regular meetings,"" the bench said while directing it to formulate recommendations on safety of Kolkata doctors within three weeks.

The hearing is currently underway.

On September 30, the apex court had expressed dissatisfaction over the ""tardy"" progress made by the West Bengal government over the installation of CCTVs and construction of toilets and separate resting rooms in government medical colleges, and directed the state to complete the ongoing work by October 15.

On September 17, the top court said it was disturbed by the findings given in the CBI's status report in the case while refusing to divulge the details and observed that any disclosure may jeopardise the ongoing investigation.

Earlier, on September 9, the top court had expressed its concern over the absence of the ""challan"" -- a key document forwarding the body of the junior doctor for postmortem -- from the records placed before it and sought a report from the West Bengal government.

On August 22, the apex court had pulled up the Kolkata police over the delay in registering the unnatural death case of the woman doctor, calling it ""extremely disturbing"" and questioned the sequence of events apart from the timing of its procedural formalities.

The top court had constituted a 10-member National Task Force to formulate a protocol for ensuring the safety and security of doctors and other healthcare professionals.

Terming the incident as ""horrific"", the apex court had censured the state government over the alleged delay in filing of the FIR and allowing thousands of people to vandalise the state-run facility.

The incident, which saw the doctor being killed with her body showing injury marks, had sparked nationwide protests. A civic volunteer was arrested by the Kolkata police in connection with the case the following day of the crime.

On August 13, the Calcutta High Court ordered the transfer of the probe from the Kolkata police to the CBI, which began its investigation on August 14.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has updated the Supreme Court on the ongoing investigation into the rape and murder of a doctor from RG Kar Medical College in Kolkata.

e4314f5e96678585616e6fec74dd731a,"[DOC 1] Only 7 per cent of doctors showed awareness about the recent advances in anti-smoking strategies, posing a significant challenge to the nation's efforts in combating tobacco addiction, a study conducted by the Indian Medical Academy for Preventive Health (IMAPH) said.

The study, based on a survey conducted among 200 doctors with a minimum of three years of experience, brought to light some eye-opening statistics.
Cardiovascular disease emerged as the most common reason for patient visits at 12 per cent, underscoring the urgent need for anti-smoking interventions.

Dr Chandrakant S Pandav, former head of the Department of Community Medicine at the AIIMS-New Delhi, expressed concern stating, “The survey sheds light on the key role doctors play in motivating smokers to quit, emphasizing the need for increased awareness and training in implementing advanced anti-smoking strategies. The findings of the survey are a wake-up call. We need to bridge the awareness gap among doctors to effectively combat tobacco harm.” Dr M Wali, senior consultant, Medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital also underlined the importance of healthcare providers being well-informed about the latest smoke cessation approaches.
He said, “Effectiveness remains a critical factor in recommending cultural and region-specific methods to combat smoking, advocating the need for science-backed policymaking to arm doctors with safer options against tobacco addiction. Therefore, doctors must stay abreast of the latest developments to offer the best guidance. It's crucial for effective tobacco control which is successfully practiced abroad.” The survey study suggests that doctors should rigorously inquire about patients' tobacco consumption at every visit. Additionally, novel alternatives like e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products could play a vital role as substitutes in reducing the burden of tobacco addiction in India.

As the second-largest tobacco consumer globally, with 275 million users, India faces a significant challenge. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey data indicates that only 55.4% of smokers have ever considered or intended to quit, showcasing the urgent need for more effective anti-smoking strategies.

In addressing the survey's stark reality, Dr J Kumar, Medical Advisor at IMAPH, emphasizes the urgent need for a united front against tobacco addiction.

“With only 7 per cent of doctors aware of recent anti-smoking advancements, this signals not just a knowledge gap but a call for revolutionary change,” Dr Kumar said.

Dr Kumar sees the survey as a compass guiding us from awareness to action. Prioritizing effectiveness over cost and embracing innovative methods, such as behavioral therapy, can bridge the gap, propelling doctors to the forefront of a tobacco-free era in India.” The research highlights the importance of science-backed policy making to empower doctors, researchers, and medical practitioners to explore and recommend safer options.

By addressing the gaps in awareness and advocating for effective strategies, India can progress towards achieving the global voluntary goal of a 30 per cent reduction in tobacco consumption by 2025.","A study by the Indian Medical Academy for Preventive Health (IMAPH) reveals that only 7% of doctors surveyed showed awareness of recent advances in anti-smoking strategies. The study involved 200 doctors with a minimum of three years of experience. Cardiovascular disease was identified as the most common reason for patient visits at 12%, emphasizing the urgency of anti-smoking interventions. The findings highlight the crucial role doctors play in motivating smokers to quit, underscoring the need for increased awareness and training in implementing advanced anti-smoking strategies. The study recommends that doctors inquire rigorously about patients' tobacco consumption and explore novel alternatives like e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products to address tobacco addiction in India, the second-largest tobacco consumer globally.

b95a5db939350a1d2effc2b85d02b8f2,"[DOC 1] Los Angeles : Nasa has logged another extraterrestrial first on its latest mission to Mars: converting carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere into pure, breathable oxygen, the US space agency said on Wednesday.

The unprecedented extraction of oxygen, literally out of thin air on Mars, was achieved on Tuesday by an experimental device aboard Perseverance, a six-wheeled science rover that landed on the Red Planet on February 18 after a seven-month journey from Earth.

In its first activation, the toaster-sized instrument dubbed MOXIE, short for Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, produced about 5 grams of oxygen, equivalent to roughly 10 minutes’ worth of breathing for an astronaut, Nasa said.

Although the initial output was modest, the feat marked the first experimental extraction of a natural resources from the environment of another planet for direct use by humans.

“MOXIE isn’t just the first instrument to produce oxygen on another world,” Trudy Kortes, director of technology demonstrations within Nasa’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement. She called it the first technology of its kind to help future missions “live off the land” of another planet.

The instrument works through electrolysis, which uses extreme heat to separate oxygen atoms from molecules of carbon dioxide, which accounts for about 95% of the atmosphere on Mars.

The remaining 5% of Mars’ atmosphere, which is only about 1% as dense Earth’s, consists primarily of molecular nitrogen and argon. Oxygen exists on Mars in negligible trace amounts.

MOXIE is designed to generate up to 10 grams per hour as a proof of concept, and scientists plan to run the machine at least another nine times over the next two years under different conditions and speeds, Nasa said..","NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars has achieved an unprecedented feat by extracting oxygen from the Martian atmosphere.

4a8d6f40ea77199eac71b66b28e7e484,"[DOC 1] The global economy, which has proved surprisingly resilient this year, is expected to falter next year under the strain of wars, still-elevated inflation and continued high interest rates.

The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated Wednesday that international growth would slow to 2.7% in 2024 from an expected 2.9% pace this year. That would amount to the slowest calendar-year growth since the pandemic year of 2020.

A key factor is that the OECD expects the world’s two biggest economies, the United States and China, to decelerate next year. The US economy is forecast to expand just 1.5% in 2024, from 2.4% in 2023, as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases — 11 of them since March 2022 — continue to restrain
growth.

The Fed’s higher rates have made borrowing far more expensive for consumers and businesses and, in the process, have helped slow inflation from its four-decade peak in 2022. The OECD foresees U.S. Inflation dropping from 3.9% this year to 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, just above the Fed’s 2% target level.

The Chinese economy, beset by a destructive real estate crisis, rising unemployment and slowing exports, is expected to expand 4.7% in 2024, down from 5.2% this year. China’s “consumption growth will likely remain subdued due to increased precautionary savings, gloomier prospects for employment creation and heightened uncertainty,? the OECD said.

Also likely to contribute to a global slowdown are the 20 countries that share the euro currency. They have been hurt by heightened interest rates and by the jump in energy prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The OECD expects the collective growth of the eurozone to amount to 0.9% next year — weak but still an improvement over a predicted 0.6% growth in 2023.","The global economy, resilient in the current year, is anticipated to face challenges in 2024 due to ongoing wars, persistent inflation, and high interest rates, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD projects a slowdown in international growth to 2.7% in 2024 from an expected 2.9% this year, marking the slowest calendar-year growth since 2020. The US and China, the world's largest economies, are expected to decelerate, with the US economy forecasted to expand by 1.5% in 2024. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes are cited as a factor restraining growth, with China facing challenges from a real estate crisis and slowing exports. The eurozone is also expected to experience sluggish growth due to increased interest rates and rising energy prices following the Ukraine conflict."

While the Kedarnath shrine, which saw large-scale devastation during the June deluge, still remains under focus, double trouble brews at the Yamunotri temple as several cracks have appeared in the structure of the shrine.

Erosion by the river under the complex and falling rocks from the Kaindi Parvat have left gaping holes across the complex. Priests fear heavy rains could wash away parts of the complex, which houses shrine to goddess Yamuna and is considered as one of the “char dhams” among the Hindus.

Over the years, the temple has borne the brunt of extreme weather conditions. Ingress of glacial waters has led to cracks in the temple structure and also the complex wall, causing concern among the local population. The priests blame it on the absence of measures by the government to protect the shrine despite reminders.

Raman Prasad Uniyal, a local priest, said: “The shrine is facing double trouble in the form of rocks falling from Kalindi Parvat just above the temple and the erosion from below, which has left gaping holes in the shrine. The structural integrity of the complex has been compromised.”

The condition may worsen once the shrine closes from November 5 for the winter season, he said. Sandeep Rana from the BJP lamented that no government representative had visited the shrine.

Barkot SDM Devmurti Yadav said they had notified senior officials about the damage to the shrine complex.

c8ba018bea7b73f32dc8624c656a0207,"[DOC 1] Pakistan’s largest province Punjab is proposing a ban on all social media platforms for six days due to security concerns during thousands of religious processions that start next week, its information minister Uzma Bukhari said on Friday.

The proposal relates to Muharram’s Ashura processions, 10 days of mourning by minority Shi’ite Muslims. The event is the holiest in the Shi’ite calendar and commemorates the 7th-century death of political and religious leader Hussain Ibn Ali.

Hussain was the grandson of the Muslims’ last Prophet Muhammad.

“It is a recommendation, and no decision has so far been taken,” Bukhari told Reuters, adding that the government had received reports of some sectarian issues on social media which he said could “put the country on fire”.

The measure is aimed at protecting the minority from sectarian violence, the provincial government wrote in a letter to Pakistan’s interior ministry on Thursday.
The letter, which was seen by Reuters, said social media platforms such as “Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Tiktok be suspended across the province of Punjab … to control hate material/misinformation”.

The interior ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Pakistan has blocked access to X since its February election, which the interior ministry said in a court submission in April was due to national security concerns.

Civil and rights groups have criticised the ban as an attack on freedom of speech and access to information in a highly polarised country amid allegations of election fraud.

Jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party has said that the suspension of cell phone service on the election day followed by the X ban was an attempt to hurt his supporters, who rely heavily on social media.","Pakistan's Punjab province is considering a six-day ban on major social media platforms during Muharram's Ashura processions, a significant religious event for Shia Muslims.

The senior ministers, intelligence officials and three service chiefs attending the meeting hurriedly convened by Modi on March 30 nodded their assent. The situation in Yemen was dire after a coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia had launched an offensive three days earlier against the anti-government Zaidi Shia rebels known as the Houthis. The contours of what was to become Operation Rahaat, a massive evacuation exercise to bring back hundreds of Indians from Yemen, were discussed at the meeting and Singh, minister of state in the external affairs ministry, was asked to immediately embark for the troubled country at the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. He was to oversee the withdrawal of Indians from Yemen's capital, Sana'a, and the cities of Aden, Ash Shihr, Al Mukalla and Al Hudaydah. Singh took the only available flight on the evening of March 31 and landed in Djibouti in Africa, from where Sana'a is an hour's flight across the Gulf of Aden. By then, the government had pulled out two merchant ships, MV Kavaratti and MV Corals, from their regular services and directed them to leave for Djibouti, which was to become Ground Zero for the Indian rescue operations over two weeks. On the night of March 30, Indian Navy's INS Tarkash, a stealth frigate, and INS Mumbai, a destroyer, also left for Djibouti. INS Sumitra, which was already on anti-piracy patrolling in the Gulf of Aden, reached the Yemeni port of Aden on the night of March 31. The control rooms of the three branches of the armed forces, external affairs ministry and Air India in New Delhi were connected with one another and with the Indian missions concerned on a real-time basis. A makeshift control room was set up at the Kempinski Hotel in Djibouti. An Indian Navy satellite was repositioned to provide minute-to-minute data on the ground situation. A Navy personnel later said the satellite streaming was so flawless that those monitoring the control room could actually count the number of people moving around in Yemen, a scene straight out of a Hollywood movie. Singh, with his years of army training, got the operation going smoothly. He held the first briefing at the Kempinski control room at 9.30 am on April 1, after which he went to meet the first tranche of 349 Indians who had arrived at Djibouti on board INS Sumitra from Aden. ""After disembarking, many of them started chanting 'Bharat mata ki jai, Indian Navy ki jai',"" recounts an official who was present at the scene. The rescued citizens rested in a commodious marriage hall at the hotel till the Indian Air Force and Air India aircraft arrived. The Navy official says the rescue of the first 349 passengers was one of the toughest challenges he had faced ever. The warring Yemeni factions were engaged in a gun battle at Aden and the immigration officers had abandoned the port. This forced Indian naval troops to first secure the port before INS Sumitra could lower its boats to ferry the stranded Indians. The task was tough also because the Saudis, who had control over the Yemeni airspace, had refused the Indian Air Force permission to land its airplanes in Sana'a. It was Air India that had to take up the task of bridging Sana'a and Djibouti. ""The Saudis gave us permission to fly for only two-and-a-half hours in a day,"" Singh says. ""The situation in Sana'a was so chaotic that it was difficult to land two planes, segregate passengers for Kochi and Mumbai, check their papers, get them on board and fly them back within the stipulated 150 minutes."" A big problem was handling people who wanted to return home, but didn't have relevant documents or exit visas and permission from the employers. ""It was costly, but the government had to arrange emergency exit documents for them,"" says Singh. Singh flew five times to Sana'a and even stayed a night there to get a first-hand experience, all the while remaining in constant touch with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. On his last flight to Sana'a, where around 450 Indians and 120 foreign nationals awaited to be extricated, Singh and his staff were told to turn back to Djibouti since the coalition fighter planes were bombing areas close to the airport. It was a tight situation - an Indian minister was on a flight that was allegedly encroaching into the airspace controlled by the Saudis. An official recalls the event: ""As the plane was approaching the Sana'a airport, we got the shock of our life with the news that fighter planes were carrying out bombings and the pilot of our aircraft had been asked to return to Djibouti immediately. The plane was diverted, but all of us, though very nervous, were anxious to reach Yemen. Amid all this, Singh stood up and said that there was no question of going back. He calmly remarked that there must be some funny military exercises going on and that we had to land at Sana'a to evacuate the last group of Indians and nationals of other countries waiting there. Singh then approached the cockpit and spoke to the pilots and told them what to convey to the Air Traffic Control at Sana'a. Having taken an arc back to Djibouti after the initial order, the aircraft did an about turn and again headed towards the Yemeni capital. ""Upon landing, we came to know that the area near the airport had been bombed not long before our plane touched down,"" says Singh. Till April 9, Indian Navy, Indian Air Force, and Air India jointly evacuated 4,640 Indian citizens and around 960 foreign nationals from 41 countries from the strife-torn country. They were brought in the five vessels assembled by the government to Djibouti from where they were flown to India on Air India planes and Indian Air Force C-17 Globemasters. INS Tarkash and INS Mumbai have since returned to India, and the Indian embassy in Sana'a is now closed. INS Sumitra has returned to its patrolling duty in the Gulf of Aden. Singh attributes the success of Operation Rahaat - the second-largest undertaken by the government of India after Operation Safe Homecoming in Libya in 2011 when 15,000 Indians were evacuated - to team work. ""It was not only the government officers who worked hard to help the stranded people, but also the local Bohra community and the Indian associations there,"" he says.","In March 2015, India undertook Operation Rahaat, a massive evacuation operation to bring back hundreds of Indians from war-torn Yemen. This involved coordination between the Indian Navy, Air Force, and Air India. The operation successfully evacuated thousands of Indian citizens and was attributed to teamwork. "
58e505eb15d3a0663b0dc00e3f17e94c,"[DOC 1] London: People who are double-vaccinated and those who have recovered from infection by previous strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have virtually no antibody protection against the Omicron variant, according to a study.

The research, recently published in the journal Allergy, found that only individuals vaccinated with a third or booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine form antibodies that can partially block Omicron.

Researchers from the Medical University of Vienna examined an Austrian subpopulation of vaccinated and recovered individuals for their antibody status and protection against the Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants.

They adapted for Omicron a test developed for the previous variants, which investigates whether the virus can bind to the receptor on human cells via its receptor binding domain (RBD).

RBD is used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter human cells via the ACE2 receptor on cells.

The researchers also examined people who had received different vaccines and combinations currently licensed in Austria.

The findings show that both COVID-19 convalescent individuals and individuals who had been vaccinated twice developed antibody protection against Delta.

However, the antibodies were not able to block receptor binding domain against Omicron, the researchers said.

The study found that blockade of Omicron was better in those individuals who had received a third vaccination.

""The third vaccination developed protective antibodies in many individuals however, there is also a significant proportion (20 per cent) in whom no protection was established,"" said Rudolf Valenta, who led the research team.

The RBD differed only slightly in all previously known SARS-CoV-2 variants, so that infections with these and the currently available vaccines provided protection against the previous variants, the researchers said.

Omicron is the first variant that differs greatly from the previous variants in RBD, consequently infections with the previous variants and currently available vaccines provide little or no protection against Omicron, they said.

The researchers noted that the best protection would be to develop a broadly effective combination vaccine that protects against both the previous variants and Omicron.

""Until we have such a vaccine, only repeated vaccinations with the existing vaccines will provide some protection,"" Valenta said.

""The protective effect achieved by vaccination can be evaluated with special tests that can be rapidly adapted to new virus variants,"" the immunologist added.",A study by the Medical University of Vienna reveals that double-vaccinated individuals and those recovered from previous SARS-CoV-2 strains have minimal antibody protection against the Omicron variant. Only a third or booster dose induces antibodies partially blocking Omicron. The study emphasizes the need for a broadly effective combination vaccine for comprehensive protection.

08a67bd32f6d7eba3b5b8fb60d6ec7b6,"[DOC 1] A 63-year-old man was gored to death by two buffaloes near Nanganallur in Chennai on Tuesday. The deceased, identified by the police as Chandrasekhar, a retired railway worker, was walking down the MGR Road when two buffaloes knocked him down.
A passerby rushed Chandrasekhar to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. His body was later taken to the Government hospital in Chromepet for post-mortem. A case has been registered in connection with the incident.
The incident has once again triggered a debate over the measures the GreaterChennaiCorporation (GCC) has taken to control the menace of stray cattle in the city.
According to the police, the two buffaloes were fighting amongst each other and suddenly attacked Chandrashekar who was walking down the street after eating at a nearby canteen.
On Wednesday, GCC Commissioner J Radhakrishnan, who inspected the area where the incident took place, instructed officials to speed up capturing of stray cattle.
While addressing the media, Radhakrishnan said, “With the current rules in place, we don’t have powers for a complete ban on stray cattle and hence we are planning to knock on the doors of the judiciary to explore other options to curb the menace of stray cattle in Chennai. Despite imposition of fines, owners are continuing to let their cattle loose on the streets.”
“There are certain rules and regulations to raise cattle but people are not following them. They are keeping their cattle in control during raids but once the authorities are leaving, they are letting them loose on the streets,” he said.
Radhakrishnan added, “This is not the first instance of life loss in a cattle attack. A few months ago, an elderly man died after he was attacked by stray cattle in Triplicane. A cattle owner himself was injured during one such attack but has fortunately survived. It is saddening to see the cattle owners not realising the dangers and continuing to do this.”
He said going forward, if cattle owners are found violating the rules on more than one occasion, the corporation will take action to cancel their ownership.
According to the officials of the civic body, after Tuesday’s death, 10 stray cattle were caught in Nanganallur alone and are being monitored.
They said in 2023 alone, as many as 4,237 cattle were caught and a fine of Rs 92.63 lakh was imposed on the owners while this January alone, 42 stray cattle have been caught and a penalty of Rs 75,000 has been imposed on the owners.
The civic body said when cattle are found left on the streets, the owners are slapped with a penalty of Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 if it’s a first-time offence and Rs 10,000 if he or she is a repeat offender. Owners whose cattle are impounded also need to pay maintenance charges of their cattle for the number of days they are housed at the various centres of the civic body.","A man was fatally attacked by stray buffaloes in Chennai, reigniting concerns over loose livestock control within the city limits. Chandrasekhar, a retired railway employee who encountered two roaming buffaloes on MGR Road and succumbed to their attack post-sustaining injuries at a hospital, died despite emergency services being dispatched in time for him not to suffer brain damage as initially suspected by police officers. The incident prompted GCC Commissioner J Radhakrishnan to push the corporation to pursue stricter measures against uncontrolled cattle handling and led officials to detain 10 more stray animals following Tuesday's fatality, amidst ongoing efforts wherein penalties have been imposed for repeat offenders. Radhakrishnan warned of possible legal action if the rule-breaking continues."
e121901468e818321ae84e3e9efeee74,"[DOC 1] IMF calls India a bright spot and retains growth rate at 6.8% in FY24 The outlook for the global economy is growing slightly brighter as China eases its zero-COVID policies and the world shows surprising resilience in the face of high inflation, elevated interest rates and Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. That's the view of the International Monetary Fund, which now expects the world economy to grow 2.9% this year. That forecast is better than the 2.7% expansion for 2023 that the IMF predicted in October, though down from the estimated 3.4% growth in 2022.
The IMF, a 190-country lending organization, foresees inflation easing this year, a result of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. Those rate hikes are expected to slow the consumer demand that has driven prices higher. Globally, the IMF expects consumer inflation to decelerate from 8.8% last year to 6.6% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024. A big factor in the upgrade to global growth was China's decision late last year to lift anti-virus controls that had kept millions of people at home. The IMF said China's ""recent reopening has paved the way for a faster-than-expected recovery."" The IMF now expects China's economy - the world's second-biggest, after the United States - to grow 5.2% this year, up from its October forecast of 4.4%. Beijing's economy eked out growth of just 3% in 2022 - the first year in more than 40, the IMF noted, that China has expanded more slowly than the world as a whole. But the end of virus restrictions is expected to revive economic activity in 2023. The IMF's 2023 growth outlook improved for the United States (forecast to grow 1.4%) as well as for the 19 countries that share the euro currency (0.7%). Europe, though suffering from energy shortages and higher prices resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, proved ""more resilient than expected,"" the IMF said. The European economy benefited from a warmer-than-expected winter, which held down demand for natural gas,
Russia's economy, hit by sanctions after its invasion of Ukraine, has proved sturdier than expected, too: The IMF's forecast foresees Russia registering 0.3% growth this year. That would mark an improvement from a contraction of 2.2% in 2022. And it's well above the 2.3% contraction for 2023 that the IMF had forecast for Russia in October. The United Kingdom is a striking exception to the IMF's brighter outlook for 2023. It has forecast that the British economy will shrink 0.6% in 2023; in October, the IMF had expected growth of 0.3%. Higher interest rates and tighter government budgets are squeezing the British economy. ""These figures confirm we are not immune to the pressures hitting nearly all advanced economies,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said in response to the IMF forecast. ""Short-term challenges should not obscure our long-term prospects - the U.K. outperformed many forecasts last year, and if we stick to our plan to halve inflation, the U.K. is still predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years."" The IMF noted that the world economy still faces serous risks. They include the possibility that Russia's war against Ukraine war will escalate, that China will suffer a sharp increase in COVID cases and that high interest rates will cause a financial crisis in debt-laden countries.
The IMF noted that the world economy still faces serous risks. They include the possibility that Russia's war against Ukraine war will escalate, that China will suffer a sharp increase in COVID cases and that high interest rates will cause a financial crisis in debt-laden countries. The global outlook has been shrouded in uncertainty since the coronavirus pandemic struck in early 2020. Forecasters have been repeatedly confounded by events: A severe if brief recession in early 2020; an expectedly strong recovery triggered by vast government stimulus aid; then a surge in inflation, worsened when Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago disrupted world trade in energy and food. Three weeks ago, the IMF's sister agency, the World Bank, issued a more downbeat outlook for the global economy. The World Bank slashed its forecast for international growth this year by nearly half - to 1.7% - and warned that the global economy would come ""perilously close"" to recession.","IMF forecasts global economy to grow by 2.9% in 2024, citing China's reopening and inflation easing. India labeled a bright spot with 6.8% growth. Risks include Russia-Ukraine conflict escalation, potential COVID resurgence in China, and financial crises in debt-laden nations. World Bank issues a more pessimistic outlook."

9f24f31d4a89ddd5c483a259a972e7e7,"[DOC 1] KOLKATA: Bargain hunters in Indian cities are flaunting a new tool: digital coupons. Digital copycats of the same old coupons that you used to cut out from paper and produce at retail outlets to avail special discounts are getting popular among marketers looking to cash in on rising use of mobile and internet in the country.

The market for coupons is estimated at close to Rs 25 crore and is expected to rocket in the short-term with many brands and retailers including Adidas and Spencer’s offering mobile and internet coupons and more such as Tatas’ Infiniti Retail and United Spirits expected to follow.

“Coupons have the potential to grow to a $1-billion market in India in 10 years,” says Kunal Bahl, CEO of Jasper Infotech, a marketing company specialising in multi-channel direct marketing solutions, which has done coupons for Baskin Robbins, Subway and Nirula’s. Digital coupons are usually mailed or text-messaged to select set of customers — be it members of a royalty scheme, or regular shoppers at an outlet, or registered users of a coupon enterprise. One can get the deal by displaying the message or a printout of the coupon at the particular outlet.

While marketers distribute coupons on their own also, more often they do it through coupon enterprises such as Jasper that provide technology platform for these offers.

There are tens of internet coupon (e-coupon) service providers in India, mostly covering the top cities in the country. Jasper owns e-coupon sites SnapDeal, which has 60,000-plus fans on Facebook, and Grabbon as well as mobile coupon (m-coupon) service MoneySaver. Other popular e-coupon platforms include Coupon Seva and Upto75.com.

They can be pretty assured of good days ahead. The reason is digital coupons are most popular among young people in the age group of 18-35. It is the same people who drive consumption in one of the youngest countries. Add to it the growth in economy, upbeat consumer sentiment and the rising number of mobile subscribers that crossed 630 million in July.

Mobile and online coupons in India started gaining steam 6-9 months back. Some popular offers include a 50% off at Subway, 15% discount on Adidas, buy one-get one free on Baskin Robbins through a mobile coupon and 20% discount on apparel on a minimum purchase of Rs 999 at Spencer's Retail.

Spencer’s took pilots for mobile coupons in Bangalore and Kolkata, which led to close to 20% redemption rates. The RPG group firm is pushing newer offers in apparel and the home segment through such coupons. “Mobile coupons are also cost-effective compared to print media,” says a Spencer’s Retail spokesperson.

While discretionary spending categories like dining, personal care and recreational activities see the maximum usage of such coupons, others like apparel, electronics and liquor are warming up to the idea.","Digital coupons are becoming a trend in Indian cities, mirroring traditional paper coupons but accessible through mobile and internet platforms. Estimated at Rs 25 crore, the market is projected to hit $1 billion in a decade. Marketers utilize platforms like Jasper Infotech for distribution. Popular among 18-35 age group, these coupons witness significant redemption rates, especially in discretionary spending sectors. Major brands like Adidas and Spencer’s are onboard, offering deals like 50% off at Subway and 15% off at Adidas. Spencer’s reports 20% redemption rates in pilot cities. The trend is fueled by economic growth, consumer sentiment, and a booming mobile subscriber base exceeding 630 million."

While the actress is upset over her eviction, she also comes with a lot of anger, especially towards Avinash Mishra and Karanveer Mehra. In an exclusive interview with SCREEN, Kashish slammed the Bigg Boss contestants as well as makers. She also declared that what many labelled as misbehavior with host Salman Khan was not wrong, according to her.

Talking about her altercation with Salman Khan and why she apologized to him, Kashish said, “I felt bad after behaving like that with him, the guilt was eating me. Even that day when I was talking I realized that I was being defensive, but it was not because I was being disrespectful but because I was put in a spot. I do understand that a lot of people don’t like it when somebody defends themselves as aggressively as I did. I was not wrong. I felt bad that I spoke to Salman sir like that, he is very senior to me and my body language even though was not wrong, wasn’t liked by him. I respected that sentiment and apologized.”

Agreeing with the popular opinion about Avinash Mishra being toxic, Kashish went on to slam the actor and said, “He is toxic, I knew it from the moment I entered. The way Avinash gets aggressive, he will flip and start saying derogatory things. He argues in a crass manner and has no class. He is very insecure and has a big ego too.”

Recently, it has been mentioned several times that both Vivian Dsena and Karanveer Mehra are leading as audience favorites. It was also said that the two have the potential to be the final contenders for the trophy. When Kashish was asked if they were strong, she said, “Not at all. When a failed product is marketed brilliantly, and you have spent a lot of money on it, everybody talks about the product. When Karanveer was marketed to me I thought he was a sensible guy, but in the house when I met him, I learned that he is far from good.”

Kashish also commented on Chahatt’s affair being discussed on national television, and said that she didn’t expect this from the makers. “Chahatt’s secret relationship is nobody’s concern, it happened outside the show and doesn’t involve any member of the show. I don’t think it was justified, not something I expected would happen on Bigg Boss,” Kashish opined.

9322efaabbc3fc00f5a3fa59a06ed9ed,"[DOC 1] Kanpur: There is a piece of good news for those commuters using public transport in the city and the environment lovers.
In order to reduce the adverse effect on our environment and provide cleaner and greener transit with state-of-the-art Zero-Emission, a first fleet of 13 Electric buses arrived in the city on Saturday.
The testing of the electric buses is being carried out, which would be made ready for public operations for one month (trial run) by first week of December this year, informed official sources.
On Saturday divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar, along with nagar ayukt, officers of smart city, officers of city buses services and officers of PMI Agency (which will manage the electric buses and charging station) visited charging station in Ahirwan to see the work progress and plan for early execution of the project on ground.

The incharge officer of PMI told officials that a total of 100 electric buses have been allotted to Kanpur city by the government. Out of which, the first lot of 13 buses arrived in the city on Saturday. Another 47 buses will come by Dec 15 and the remaining 40 buses will come in January 2022.The PMI incharge officer said that there are a total 25 charging stations/points planned for the operation of 100 buses. Five charging stations will be fully ready by Nov 27 and the 13 buses can be charged at these five points from Nov 28 onwards.

The rest 20 charging points would be completed by Dec 15 and then they would be tested for operations one week after that.

Commissioner, nagar ayukt and team shared about the features of buses like, CCTV coverage, safety measures like panic button, alarm , wireless set, emergency stoppage function and touch panel for overall control of bus operations. All the features are under checking and they would all be checked and certified in the next one week.

The commissioner ordered a committee of city bus officers, smart city officers, PMI representatives and one expert from IIT or HBTU for the final checking and certification of the buses before deploying them for general operations.

Looking into the need for a large public toilet at the charging stations, commissione also asked the nagar ayukt to prepare an estimate for the same and get it done in the next two months.


Nagar Ayukt also updated the commissioner that the road widening work and underground cabling work is in progress and would be completed by Dec 15, this year.

Along with this, the proposal of 500 meters additional road connectivity would also be taken up by the end of next month and would be completed by January 2022.


This will ease the problem of traffic congestion in the area and will ensure smooth movement of electric buses to and from the charging station at Ahirwan.","Kanpur welcomes its first fleet of 13 electric buses aimed at reducing environmental impact and providing cleaner transit. Testing is underway, with plans for public operation by December. A total of 100 buses are allotted, with charging stations set to accommodate them. Safety features and infrastructure readiness are being ensured before deployment, with additional measures like road widening and toilet facilities in progress."
6f1c73e12cf2e28f68a33ffdf1c7d24b,"[DOC 1] It is noteworthy that health care-related subjects have been capturing media attention and holding it on for three months now. It started in February 2010 with the proposal for a short-term medical course to expedite the process of expanding the number of doctors serving in rural India. There has also been some focus on the inadequacy of funds to implement health care schemes and the need for increased spending on them. And then came the report that the Union Cabinet has given approval to a bill that would regulate private hospitals and pave the way for guaranteeing “the right to emergency care” for accident victims and the like.

As a prelude to ensuring ‘the right to emergency care,' the Union Cabinet recently approved the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2010; the hope is it will be placed before Parliament soon. The Bill makes it mandatory for all clinical establishments in the country to provide treatment to any person in an emergency condition. When the Bill becomes law, it will be the first piece of legislation to make it obligatory for the clinical establishments to provide emergency treatment to the needy.

Reluctance to treat accident victims

The Bill does not prescribe imprisonment for non-compliance, but it gives powers to the registering authority to impose a hefty fine (up to a maximum of Rs. 5 lakh). If not paid, the fine amount will be recovered under the Revenue Recovery Act. Clinical establishments are generally reluctant to treat accident victims, fearing legal problems, and so refer them to government-run hospitals. Several private hospitals and nursing homes refuse admission to women if they are not prepared to pay the treatment charges in advance.

The new enactment followed a Supreme Court direction, as far back as 1989, that emergency care should not be denied to anyone for any reason. In Parmanand Katara vs Union of India, the court accepted an application by an advocate. Referring to a news item titled “Law helps the injured to die” in the Hindustan Times , the lawyer brought to the court's notice the difficulties those injured in accidents faced in accessing to life-saving medical treatment. Many doctors and hospitals refused to treat them unless certain formalities were completed in these medico-legal cases. The Supreme Court directed the medical establishments to provide instant medical assistance to the affected people, notwithstanding the formalities to be followed under procedural criminal law. It has taken 21 years for the executive to come up with draft legislation on the subject.

The rigorous pursuit of neo-liberal reforms and the consequent withdrawal of the state from many areas in the social sector stood in the way of regulating private sector service-providers in respect of medical care. However, persistent efforts by social workers, political activists, and women's organisations have put some constructive pressure on governments at the Centre and in the States to think of some pro-poor healthcare reforms.","Health care has been a major media focus since February 2010, starting with proposals to expand rural medical services and highlighting insufficient funding. Recently, the Union Cabinet approved the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2010, mandating emergency treatment in private hospitals. The Bill, awaiting parliamentary approval, will impose fines up to Rs. 5 lakh for non-compliance but not imprisonment. It follows a 1989 Supreme Court ruling requiring emergency care despite procedural delays. This legislation responds to long-standing issues in private hospital practices and reflects ongoing efforts for pro-poor healthcare reforms despite neoliberal challenges."
39d5255ceb19e75d702f2cfb5beb9cc1,"[DOC 1] It is shameful that a Dalit youth in Punjab should be tied to a pillar, forced to drink urine and mercilessly killed even as celebrations of Guru Nanak’s anniversary are at their peak and his teachings that transformed a caste-ridden society are being reinforced with a renewed vigour. The brutal thrashing that Sangrur's Jagmale Singh had to endure, leading up to the amputation of his legs and a painful death, shows that our society has a long way to go before it is rid of the abhorrent caste-based atrocities.

Bant Singh, a Dalit Sikh of Punjab seeking justice for the gangrape of his daughter in 2006, was luckier. He survived an attack, though he lost his limbs. The demands for justice to the victims’ families must channelise us to social reform. The government should not put a lid on this heinous crime with the awarding of compensation to the victims’ families. Otherwise, it would be just another statistic in the gory list of inhuman acts. The outrage over the latest heart-wrenching brutality of September when two Dalit children in MP were thrashed to death for defecating in the open must not go in vain.

While such extreme instances are rare, they underscore the simmering undercurrent of continued social oppression and economic deprivation of the lower caste strata in Punjab. Atrocities are heaped upon them in many small ways as social hierarchical divisions remain well entrenched and are difficult to pierce through. The low conviction rate in such crimes only encourages the perpetuation of criminal discrimination that pits people against one another. The National Crime Records Bureau survey reveals that while crimes against SCs/STs have registered a significant spike (40/118 per cent), the conviction rate under laws to prevent abuse on them is a mere 28 per cent as against 46 per cent under the IPC. The legal deterrents need to be coupled with a social and political awakening for people to breach the caste barrier and end oppression of the underprivileged.","The recent brutal killing of a Dalit youth in Punjab highlights the persistent caste-based atrocities and social oppression that exist in Indian society. The victim, Jagmale Singh, was tied to a pillar, forced to drink urine, and eventually killed. This incident, along with others like the thrashing of two Dalit children in Madhya Pradesh, emphasizes the need for social reform and justice for the victims' families. The low conviction rate in crimes against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes further indicates the challenges in addressing this issue. Combining legal deterrents with social and political awareness is crucial to breaking down caste barriers and ending the oppression of marginalized communities.

Launching the land struggle, Dr T.M. Thomas Issac, former Finance Minister and the party central committee member, said the party would strongly oppose any move to convert the Aranmula Puncha (paddy land) in the name of a private airport project.

Inaugurating a march, jointly launched by the Kerala State Karshaka Thozhilali Union (KSKTU) and the Kerala Karshaka Sanghom at Aranmula on Tuesday, Dr Issac said the previous Left Democratic Front Government had given an in-principle clearance for setting up a private airport in Aranmula, only after strictly complying with the prevailing laws of the land. Even this conditional permission should not have been made in the case of Aranmula, taking into consideration its disastrous socio-environmental implications, the former Finance Minister has said.

The former Chief Minister, V.S. Achuthanandan, too had made a similar statement while addressing a mammoth rally against the airport project in Aranmula, earlier. Mr Achuthanandan had blamed the then Principal Secretary to Industries department, T. Balakrishnan, for issuing a notification declaring a large extent of land spread across the three villages of Aranmula, Mallappuzhasserry and Kidangannur as industrial area allegedly “with out taking the Government into confidence.’’

Ordinance in the making

Dr Issac said an anti-people ordinance giving free hand for conversion of paddy land in an industrial area and permission to keep unlimited extent of land was awaiting the consent of the Governor. Once the ordinance came into force, the District Collector’s order for acquiring the excess land at Aranmula would become null and void, he added.

The Revenue Minister, Adoor Prakash, says that the District Collector has already issued order to acquire the excess land identified at Aranmula. Ironically, none other than the Congress(I)-led United Progressive Alliance Government at the Centre had given various clearances for the proposed airport project, in scant disregard to various laws of the land, the CPI(M) leader alleged.

Dr Issac alleged that the promoters of the proposed Aranmula airport claimed to have obtained various Central clearances for the project at a time when the Union Government was yet to give clearances for the much sought-after Vizhinjom project.

Excess land in Aranmula

The former Finance Minister said the Government should acquire the illegally converted excess paddy land in Aranmula for distribution among the homeless poor with out any further delay. The remaining excess paddy land should be distributed among the farm workers, he added.

Satyagraha launched

The CPI(M), KSKTU and the Karshaka Sanghom workers have also started a satyagraha at the Aranmula Puncha on Tuesday.

Dr Issac said not less than 250 workers would take part in the satyagraha on a daily basis and it would continue till January 8. A. Padmakumar, and K.M. Gopi, CPI(M) leaders, will lead the satyagraha.

Dr Issac further warned that the protesters would start occupying the excess land by erecting huts from January 8, if the Government failed to acquire the excess land from the land grabbers by then.

He said steps should also be taken to launch cultivation in the Aranmula Puncha after clearing the partially converted natural streams.

Dr Issac, accompanied by K. Ananthagopan, CPI(M) district secretary; R. Unnikrishna Pillai, State committee member; Omalloor Sankaran, Karshaka Sanghom district president; A.P. Udayabhanu, KSKTU district secretary; P.K. Kumaran, A. Padmakumar, former MLAs; R. Ajayakumar, Malayalappuzha Mohan, and M.S.

Khaitan joined the board of CESC in 1994 at the personal invitation of close friend and founder of the group, late Rama Prasad Goenka.

Khaitan — regarded the doyen of the tea industry as promoter of the Williamson Magor group, the world ' s largest bulk tea producer – tendered his resignation with immediate effect, CESC informed the bourses on Wednesday.

Although no specific reason was cited to the bourses, Khaitan is believed to have stepped down because of his advancing age. He turned 90 a year ago.

Khaitan ' s association with the Goenka family runs beyond the confines of the boardroom though. RP Goenka ' s niece Yashodhara was married to Khaitan ' s elder son Deepak, who passed away four years back.

The CESC board, apart from Khaitan, also witnessed a reshuffle at the top deck.

Aniruddha Basu, the managing director of the company that supplies electricity to Calcutta, is stepping down at the expiry of his term on May 28.

The company appointed two managing directors to look after the generation and production separately as CESC prepares to split the company into four verticals along business activities.

Debasish Banerjee, who was the chief executive officer of Reliance Energy, has been hired as the new managing director ( distribution). Rabi Chowdhury, who was the managing director of CESC subsidiary Haldia Energy will now be MD ( generation).

Both appointments take effect from May 28 for a period of five years. Once the split takes place, the power generation business will be housed in a single entity while the distribution ventures will be packed into another. The two other verticals will be engaged into retail and new businesses ( real estate, FMCG and business process outsourcing).

Profit jumps CESC ' s consolidated profit jumped 42.5 per cent to Rs 1,155 crore in 2017- 18 from Rs 810 crore a year ago.

Total income also went up 17.1 per cent to Rs 16,441 crore, from Rs 14202 crore in 2016- 17.

The company appears to have gained significantly by reducing interest costs, apart from doing well operationally in the power vertical.

Finance cost went down to Rs 1,374 crore in 2017- 18 from Rs 1,497 crore a year back. The segment result published on Wednesday also showed an uptick in the power business to Rs 2,508 crore from Rs 2,293 crore. The retail business under Spencer ' s Retail continued to remain under stress.

Before tax and interest expense, the operations suffered a loss of Rs 118 crore compared with Rs 67 crore in 2016- 17.

Profit before tax and interest cost from the property vertical – mainly from the rental earning from Quest mall in Calcutta – went up to Rs 67 crore from Rs 34 crore.","Brij Mohan Khaitan, known for his prominent role in the tea industry, has resigned from the board of CESC after a 24-year tenure. Khaitan, who joined the board in 1994 at the invitation of Rama Prasad Goenka, cited advancing age as a likely reason for his departure. Alongside Khaitan's resignation, CESC is witnessing changes at the executive level.

Debasish Banerjee and Rabi Chowdhury are slated to assume these roles.

fafac4ea142c82195718db2b872e92c8,"[DOC 1] The Congress party’s decision to remove senior leader Digvijaya Singh from the post of party in charge of Karnataka has signalled a change in guard in the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) too, according to State leaders.

With the removal of Mr. Singh, which was welcomed by several leaders though not publicly, the party sources said change in the KPCC leadership is likely to happen soon. The party high command has been taking a cautious approach to ensure smooth transition of power in the State Congress. The KPCC will get a new boss to work in tandem with the new AICC team, leaders said.

After last month’s visit to the State by Mr. Singh, hectic lobbying had begun for the KPCC president post with the Congress high command conveying the need to induct new dynamism into the party rank and file ahead of the Assembly polls.

Apparently, State Congress leaders are mounting pressure on the central leadership to appoint a full-time KPCC president to counter the BJP, which was facing rebellion within. The Congressmen want an early end to the uncertainty over who will head the party.

In a bit to grab the KPCC top post, Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil held consultations with central leaders in Delhi last week. Though a group loyal to incumbent G. Parameshwara openly advocating the need for his continuance in the post, a vast section of the leaders, including Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, is said to be more in favour of a Lingayat leader from north Karnataka, with the intention of securing the dominant community’s votes.

Speaking in Tumakuru on Sunday, Dr. Parameshwara said: “If the party high command makes changes, I will abide by it.” Mr. Siddaramaiah is also looking for a new KPCC president who is amenable and with whom he can select candidates for the 2018 poll. Other candidates making a strong claim for the post are former Minister and Lingayat leader S.R. Patil, Energy Minister and Vokkaliga strongman D.K. Shivakumar and Dalit leader and MP K.H. Muniyappa.

","The Congress party's decision to remove Digvijaya Singh as the party in charge of Karnataka signals a potential leadership shift within the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC). The move has sparked discussions among state leaders about the likelihood of a new KPCC president being appointed soon. State Congress leaders are urging the central leadership to expedite the appointment to counter BJP's internal turmoil. Various contenders, including Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil and incumbent G. Parameshwara, are vying for the position, with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah favoring a Lingayat leader to secure votes from the dominant community. The search for a new KPCC president reflects the party's preparation for the upcoming Assembly polls in 2018.

Italy is the seventh largest economy in the world with a GDP of $1782 billion. It is also the second largest manufacturing hub in Europe after Germany.","Italy emerges as a new trade interest for India after Korea and Japan, as Invitalia and Deloitte present investment opportunities to the Indian business community.

The Maharashtra Arts’ Teachers Association has written to the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education seeking an extension to apply for the extra marks. Friday was the last date to apply for extra marks.
Dinkar Patil, chairman of the state board, said the board will consider the demand and will send a proposal to the education ministry to resolve the issue.
Normally, the intermediate drawing examinations are held in September, but the pandemic put it off this time. Hence, standard X students who have completed their elementary examination, and were supposed to appear for intermediate examination this year, could not exercise the option, and would not be eligible for additional marks if they clear the intermediate examination.

Sunil Borole, secretary of the Pune chapter of the association, said, “Students are eligible to apply for elementary examination in drawing after the age of 12 (class VII) and after qualifying, they can apply for the intermediate examination. Based on the grade one gets in the intermediate examination, they get additional marks in the board exams.”

He said if conducting the examination is not possible at this short a notice, then marks can also be given based on the elementary examination performance.

“There are students who have not yet received their certificate for the 2019 intermediate exam,” Borole added.


Dinkar Patil, chairman of the state board, said, “We have got the representation from the association of arts teachers. Since there is a pandemic and late reopening of schools we need to take decisions, accordingly. As the intermediate examination has not been held yet, this issue also needs to be looked into. We will send a proposal to the ministry and further decisions will be taken after discussions with the higher officials.”
","Standard X students in Maharashtra face a challenge in securing additional marks for the drawing intermediate certificate as this year's exam hasn't taken place yet. The Maharashtra Arts' Teachers Association has urged the State Board to extend the application deadline for these marks, which closed recently. Typically held in September, the intermediate drawing exams were postponed due to the pandemic, affecting students who were due to appear for them alongside their board exams. Without this exam, these students won't be eligible for the additional marks, crucial for their board exam scores.

Sunil Borole from the Pune chapter of the association suggested granting marks based on elementary exam performance if conducting the intermediate exam isn't feasible on short notice. Some students also await their 2019 intermediate exam certificates. Chairman Dinkar Patil assured that the board will propose a solution to the education ministry, considering the pandemic's impact and the delayed school reopening, ensuring fair decisions after discussions with higher authorities."

An unprecedented 11.9 million houses, which is about 10% of the Census 2011 urban housing stock, have been sanctioned across its five sub-schemes. The aggressive housing agendas of a few states and the popularity of the Beneficiary-Led Construction (BLC) sub-scheme (which provides subsidies for the construction of a house to land-owning Economically Weaker Section (EWS) households—i.e., households with an annual income of ₹3 lakh or less) in small cities were key to PMAY-U’s scale. We find that PMAY-U better serves small cities compared to million-plus cities. Two aspects of PMAY-U warrant attention: its poor coverage of slum households and the significant number of delayed and yet-to-be-completed houses. Some of the issues affecting PMAY-U’s implementation are specific to PMAY-U and easier to resolve, while others are systemic in nature. Some of the systemic issues are complex property records and registration systems, slow dispute resolution, and EWS households’ poor access to institutional finance. Based on our findings, we propose improvements in programme design and monitoring, as well as broader systemic measures required to make the recently announced second phase of PMAY-U more impactful than the first.

Hindi films today are crude and titillating: Om Puri

Hindi films today are crude and titillating: Om Puri
Veteran actor Om Puri lashed out at Bollywood when asked why he was doing lesser Hindi films now.

Blaming the so called ‘new age cinema’ for deterioration in quality of content, Puri said, “I am not a selling star. They don’t write roles for old people like me anymore. The only ones in my age group who are getting roles today are star ‘brands’…like Amitabh Bachchan.""
Om Puri, who is now returning to theatre after 25 years, says his decision to do theatre is driven by lack of Hindi film offers coming his way.

“The new boys, directors like Anurag (Kashyap), Abhishek (Kapoor) etc. are doing good work but, unfortunately they cannot sustain their level. Initially they start off with lofty ideals but quickly fall for the greed of money,” he says, adding, “Hindi films today are crude and titillating. They are giving the wrong kind of education to the masses. And no, I don’t buy the argument that films today are made on demand of what people want to watch. For even if that’s true, it is our bloody responsibility to reform society.”


Puri even blames the contemporary actors for auguring this trend. “Stars say with great pride that, ‘we are not social reformers, we are entertainers’. That is so decrepit an alibi to give out as an actor,” he said.","Om Puri, a veteran actor, criticized today's Hindi films for their crude and titillating content, blaming the trend on new age cinema and star-driven roles sidelining older actors like himself. He expressed disappointment in the lack of substantial roles and highlighted a shift towards commercialism over quality. Puri praised new directors initially but criticized their inability to sustain integrity, accusing them of succumbing to monetary greed. He condemned the negative influence of contemporary films on society, rejecting the notion that films merely cater to audience demands without responsibility. Puri also criticized actors who prioritize entertainment over social responsibility."

Railway officials on duty at the station had shown presence of mind and taken the criticalThe stampede began at 10.26 a.m., but for the next half-hour, until 11 a.m., Western Railway
local services kept running — at least 10 up trains and 10 down trains stopped at the
station during the period — disgorging even more passengers on to the platform, and from
there to the foot over bridge (FOB). The crowd on the bridge had begun increasing because
it was raining, and people were reluctant to step out from the shelter the FOB offered into
the open street.
Malini Iyer, who was in the crush, but escaped only with scratches on her hands pushing
her way through the mass of people, said, “The railway officials could have saved
passengers if they have made some announcement regarding the stampede and asked
passengers to avoid going towards north bridge.”
“The passengers kept coming at the bridge as train came at the platform,” says Shankar
Singh, who was at the station at the time of stampede. “The passengers gathered at the
bridge and everybody wanted to exit and go to their destinations.”
The FOB is narrow, and also serves the adjacent Parel station (Central Railway, Main Line),
connecting both stations to each other and the roads alongside the railway lines. It can
accommodate around 100 commuters at a time without getting overcrowded; but
eyewitnesses say that there were more than 1,000 passengers on the FOB when the
stampede happened.

Washington


: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on January 19, kept India's growth projection unchanged at 7.3 per cent in the current fiscal and 7.5 per cent in the next, even as it cut world economic outlook to 3.4 per cent for 2016. In its update on World Economic Outlook (WEO), IMF said China's growth would slow to 6.3 per cent in 2016 and further to 6 per cent in 2017, but India would continue to grow at a ""robust pace"".

""India and the rest of emerging Asia are generally projected to continue growing at a robust pace, with some countries facing strong headwinds from China's economic rebalancing and global manufacturing weakness,"" IMF said.

As for the world growth, IMF on January 19, forecast 3.4 per cent for 2016 and 3.6 per cent for 2017. For India, it retained the growth forecast at 7.3 per cent for the current fiscal and 7.5 per cent for 2016-17 and 2017-18.


""Risks to the global outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate to ongoing adjustments in the global economy a generalised slowdown in emerging market economies, China's rebalancing, lower commodity prices, and the gradual exit from extraordinarily accommodative monetary conditions in the United States,"" IMF added.

""If these key challenges are not successfully managed, global growth could be derailed,"" it cautioned.

IMF said the pick-up in global activity is projected to be more gradual than in the October WEO, especially in emerging market and developing economies. In the last WEO update released in October, IMF had projected India to grow at 7.3 per cent in the current fiscal and 7.5 per cent in 2016-17.


As for world growth, it had put the figures at 3.6 per cent for 2016 and 3.8 per cent for 2017. Emerging market and developing economies account for over 70 per cent of the global growth. IMF said in advanced economies, a modest and uneven recovery is expected to continue, with a gradual further narrowing of output gaps.

""The picture for emerging market and developing economies is diverse, but in many cases challenging. The slowdown and rebalancing of the Chinese economy, lower commodity prices and strains in some large emerging market economies will continue to weigh on growth prospects in 2016-17,"" it said.

The three key transitions that would influence the global outlook, it said, include gradual slowdown and rebalancing of economic activity in China from investment and manufacturing to consumption and services. Also, lower prices for energy and other commodities, and a gradual tightening in monetary policy in the United States in the context of a resilient US recovery are also expected to have a bearing on global outlook.


IMF said oil prices have declined markedly since September 2015 in anticipation of sustained increases in production by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in an already oversupplied market. Futures markets indicate only modest increases in prices in 2016 and 2017. Prices of other commodities, especially metals, have fallen as well, it said.

""The pick-up in consumption in oil importers has so far been somewhat weaker than evidence from past episodes of oil price declines would have suggested, possibly reflecting continued deleveraging in some of these economies,"" it added.

""Limited pass-through of price declines to consumers may also have been a factor in several emerging market and developing economies.""


IMF projected advanced economies' growth to rise by 0.2 percentage point in 2016 to 2.1 per cent and hold steady in 2017. Growth in emerging market and developing economies is projected to increase from 4 per cent in 2015 the lowest since the 2008-09 financial crisis to 4.3 per cent and 4.7 per cent in 2016 and 2017, respectively.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has maintained India's growth projection at 7.3% in the current fiscal and 7.5% in the next, despite a cut in the world economic outlook to 3.4% for 2016. The IMF forecasted China's growth to slow to 6.3% in 2016 and further to 6% in 2017, but India would continue to grow at a ""robust pace"". The pick-up in global activity is expected to be more gradual than in the October WEO, especially in emerging market and developing economies."

At a time when England are hellbent on revolutionising Test cricket with their sam-bang 'Bazball' approach that believes in attacking cricket come what may, an opening batter, Ian Bestwick, batted 137 balls for 0 runs in a Division Nine Derbyshire Cricket League match between Darley Abbey Cricket Club's 4th XI and Mickleover 3rd XI.The level and standards of Stokes' side and this club match are not comparable by any means but it does give an indication that Bazball has yet to have a major impact on the roots of English cricket.

After Mickleover 3rd XI posted 271/4 in 35 years, quite similar to the Bazball style, where opening batter Max Thompson smashed 186 off just 128 balls, the Darley Abbey Cricket Club's 4th XI batters shut shop in the most watertight way possible, ending up with just 21 runs for the loss of four wickets in 45 overs.

Only two of the six Darley batters got off the mark, but none of them went past the double-figure mark. The extras (9) were the highest scorer even after 45 overs of cricket.The father-son duo of Ian Bestwick and Thomas Bestwick were the main architects behind the blockathon. While Ian faced a remarkable 137 deliveries without scoring a single run. His son, Thomas, played out 71 balls for just four. 70 of those were dot balls, as Thomas' only scoring shot was a boundary.

""It's gone round the world,"" 48-year-old Ian Bestwick told BBC Radio Derby after the match. ""It has been mentioned in Australia, Pakistan, Qatar. I have had friend requests from around the globe.""

The match ended in a draw but Mickleover 3rd XI got more points due to game rules. Both of them, however, are languishing at the bottom half of the points table.

‘Towards the end, I was determined not to score’: Ian Bestwick","England Test captain Ben Stokes might find it amusing or perplexing that in a Division Nine Derbyshire Cricket League match, a batter, Ian Bestwick, faced 137 balls without scoring a run. This approach starkly contrasts with the aggressive ""Bazball"" strategy that Stokes and the England team advocate, which emphasizes a fearless, attacking style of play.

In the match between Darley Abbey Cricket Club's 4th XI and Mickleover 3rd XI, the latter scored 271/4 in 35 overs, aligning with a high-scoring approach. However, Darley Abbey's response was markedly different. They managed just 21 runs for four wickets in 45 overs, with only two batters reaching double figures. Ian Bestwick's remarkable innings of 137 balls for zero runs, alongside his son Thomas's 71-ball four, showcased an extreme defensive strategy. 

The game ended in a draw, but Mickleover 3rd XI secured more points due to the league rules. Ian Bestwick's unconventional approach, which gained international attention, highlights the contrast between traditional defensive strategies and the more aggressive philosophies currently popular in higher levels of cricket."

A UNICEF report indicates that Russia ranks third globally in per capita teenage suicides, with a rate of 22 per 100,000, significantly higher than the worldwide average of 7. Medvedev and others warn that media attention could exacerbate the situation by encouraging copycat behaviors among vulnerable youths."

ac374c06aaf58fc19b23bb08f076085f,"[DOC 1] The 73rd amendment to the Constitution brought about a comprehensive change in the field of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj system in the country paving the way for several reformative measures in the field, Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs and Legislation H.K. Patil has said.

He was inaugurating a two-day national seminar on “Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj”, organised to mark three decades of the 73rd Amendment to the Constitution by the Karnataka State Rural Development and Panchayat Raj University in Gadag on Friday.

Mr. Patil said that late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was the pioneer in making efforts to materialise Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of gram swaraj and it was during the tenure of the late Prime Minister Narasimha Rao that the amendment was brought. The amendment brought about comprehensive changes in the field including implementation of reservation at the gram panchayat level and enabling members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes to become heads of gram panchayats, he said.

The Minister stressed the need for analysing the journey of three decades after the 73rd amendment. “Compared to the national level, the panchayats in the State are in a better position. Members of SC/ST, the poor and women have become presidents of the panchayats. Although social reformer Basavanna advocated equality and equal representation to women in all spheres of life back in the twelfth century, until the 73rd amendment was brought, it had not materialised. In the implementation of the amendment, Karnataka is at the forefront,” he said.

He said that the panchayat raj system had great potential to bring about change and the State government was taking steps to further empower the panchayat raj institutions, he said emphasising the need for more transparency in the functioning of these institutions.

Former Chief Secretary of the Karnataka government T.M. Vijaybhaskar recalled the days when KSRDPRU was set up and he commended the way the university was functioning to bring about a comprehensive change in rural development.

Despite several measures there were still need for effective mechanism to ensure strengthening of the panchayat raj institutions, he said.

Director of Panchayat Raj Commissionerate Ekanthappa said that there was need for gram panchayats playing effective role in monitoring the development works in their jurisdiction.

","The 73rd Amendment to the Indian Constitution, commemorated at a national seminar, revolutionized Rural Development and Panchayat Raj systems. Minister H.K. Patil highlighted its significance, attributing late PM Rajiv Gandhi and PM Narasimha Rao for its inception. The amendment ensured reservation at the gram panchayat level, empowering marginalized groups. Patil lauded Karnataka's progress in implementing these reforms, emphasizing Basavanna's advocacy for gender equality. He stressed the need for transparency and further empowerment of panchayats. Former Chief Secretary T.M. Vijaybhaskar praised the Karnataka State Rural Development and Panchayat Raj University's role. Ekanthappa of the Panchayat Raj Commissionerate emphasized the importance of active gram panchayat involvement in local development monitoring.

As I said, I'm not perfect but I'm trying,"" Joshua told the cheering crowd from the ring.""As boxing states, you leave your ego at the door and you respect your opponent. So a massive shout out to Wladimir Klitschko.""""The best man won tonight and it's a massive event for boxing,"" responded Klitschko after his second defeat in succession at the hands of a British heavyweight following the loss of his titles to Tyson Fury 17 months ago after an 11-year reign.""Two gentleman fought each other. Anthony was better today. It's really sad I didn't make it.""The fight attracted a gate that had not been matched for a British show since Len Harvey fought Jock McAvoy for the British light-heavyweight title at another London venue, White City, in 1939.The mutual praise between Joshua and Klitschko echoed the civilised and respectful way the two former Olympic champions had behaved in the build-up to the contest but there was nothing civil about the brutal punishment they dished out to each other.After four rounds of feeling each other out, with Klitschko's movement and Joshua's power quite apparent, the crowd were not prepared for an astonishing fifth round.First, Joshua launched a blistering left hook and followed up with a flurry of punches that saw the Ukrainian drop to his knees and, when he rose groggily, take a standing count.Klitschko suddenly looked old and the end seemed nigh as Joshua roared in to finish the job but that was when he found his champion's spirit in his desperation, landing a big left of his own to leave Joshua in real peril.
","British boxer Anthony Joshua defeated his Ukrainian rival Wladimir Klitschko in the 11th round to be crowned the IBF, WBA and IBO world heavyweight champion in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. Joshua, who extended his unbeaten record in professional boxing to 19-0, knocked down the 41-year-old former champion twice in the title bout.

f21e4910b0cce19c32df2cbd727e8c8e,"[DOC 1] The rupee weakened below the psychologically critical barrier of 80 against the dollar for the first time in the spot market on Tuesday morning. While the recent depreciation has been rapid, it may not be as fast as some other phases in the past 25 years, a Mint analysis suggests.

The local currency hit a record low of 80.06 to a dollar on the day, but the Reserve Bank of India’s intervention helped reverse some of the losses. The rupee ended trading at 79.95 to a dollar.

Since closing below 75 for the first time on 20 March 2020, the rupee has taken 566 trading days to touch the 80-mark. The decline from 60 to 65 is the fastest on record in this century: it took just 42 days during the US Federal Reserve’s taper tantrums of 2013. It took 382 days for the domestic currency to slip from 70 to 75.

The analysis looks at the first time the rupee closed a trading day below each milestone—selected as multiples of five—and excluded instances when it may have touched a mark intraday, except Tuesday’s 80 level. The comparison should only be seen as the trend of key milestones in the rupee’s journey against the dollar and not interpreted as the overall pace of depreciation, which shows a lot more variation.

Rupee has been sliding rather sharply since the Russia-Ukraine war in late February, and has been under further pressure due to the sharp interest rate hikes by the US Fed. Hovering around 75 in mid-February, the rupee has fallen 6.6% since then. In comparison, currencies such as Mexican peso (0.9%), Indonesian rupiah (4.4%) and Brazilian real (5.5%) have depreciated less whereas euro (10.4%) and Japanese yen (16.7%) have depreciated more than the rupee. Russian ruble and British pound have appreciated during this period. The rupee’s decline comes after its resilience through the pandemic, and it had in fact gained against the dollar between April 2020 and March 2021. The worst yearly decline in the period of analysis was 19.2% in 2008.

As earlier reported by Mint, it’s not the depreciation but the pace of rupee volatility that RBI is watchful of. While the rupee’s plunge has been sharp of late, it’s still no way close to the volatility last seen during the taper tantrum of 2013 and the Great Recession of 2008-09 .

","The Indian Rupee fell below the critical 80-mark against the dollar for the first time, hitting a record low of 80.06 before closing at 79.95 due to the Reserve Bank of India's intervention. This comes after a sharp depreciation since the Russia-Ukraine war and US Fed's interest rate hikes. Despite the rapid fall, the pace of volatility is not as high as during the 2013 taper tantrum or the 2008-09 Great Recession. The rupee's journey from 75 to 80 took 566 trading days, slower than its fastest recorded decline from 60 to 65 in just 42 days."

This instruction assumed more meaning in the next few days when an omnibus driver, under the influence of alcohol, hit a bike and an autorickshaw in Nagercoil Town and got detained along with the vehicle, thanks to the policemen deployed near the spot.

Mr. Santosh Hadimani, before starting the drive, instructed the companies operating the omni buses to check every day their drivers for consumption of alcohol while on duty. He also made it clear to the bus company managements that the intoxicated driver would not be allowed to operate the bus if he had consumed alcohol while on duty and hence the companies would be doubly cautious in this connection in the best interest of their passengers.

Since the omnibuses would usually take the passengers near Veinthankulam new bus stand and near the Vannarpet flyover in Palayamkottai, two teams of policemen, led by Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Ashok Kumar, with the breathalyzers were deployed to check the drivers and the assistants of more than 40 omni buses.

“We’ll screen the drivers with breathalysers almost everyday as we’ve to ensure the safety of the passengers. If a driver is found to be under the influence of alcohol, a fine of ₹10,000 will be slapped on him besides registering case against him. If a case is registered, he’ll be removed from service by their management and finding the new job will become impossible. Hence, the drivers should have clean habits and take utmost care in the safety of their passengers,” Mr. Ashok Kumar told the drivers.

The drive did not find any drunk drivers on last Sunday.

Addressing a press conference after launching the Economic Survey 2024–25, a key pre-budget document highlighting the economic performance of the government in the fiscal year 2024-25, Aurangzeb said the GDP growth in 2023 was -0.2pc, which rose to 2.5pc in 2024.

“This year, we announced a 2.7pc growth for 2025. This is a gradual recovery and the right way to go about it is to focus on sustainable growth,” he said.

He also placed Pakistan’s recovery within the broader global context, noting that the global GDP growth has reached 2.8 per cent.

""The next fiscal year will be a turnaround story,” he said, setting the tone for a budget expected to aim for IMF compliance, increased revenue, and growth-focused reforms.

Highlighting macroeconomic indicators, Aurangzeb said the current account recorded a surplus of $1.9 billion during July–April FY25, driven by strong IT exports, which were about $3.5 billion.

“Remittances are projected to reach $37–38 billion by year-end, up from $27 billion two years ago,” he said.

Talking about macroeconomic indicators, the minister said, “public debt and debt-to-GDP ratio was 68 per cent, which is now 65 per cent.

He said forex reserves as of June 30, 2024, were $9.4 billion, which was a remarkable recovery from 2023 when Pakistan was down to two weeks of import cover.

He said foreign exchange reserves rose to $16.64 billion in 2025, boosted by improved economic indicators and renewed investor confidence. Of the total reserves, the State Bank of Pakistan held $11.5 billion, while commercial banks retained $5.14 billion.

He said that the increase follows improved credit ratings, with Fitch upgrading Pakistan’s sovereign rating from CCC+ to B- with a stable outlook.

The minister announced plans to privatise 24 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the coming year, after curbing annual losses of Rs800 billion.

The minister said agriculture grew 2.6 per cent while construction posted a 6.6 per cent growth rate, while services expanded by 2.9 per cent.

The Pakistan Economic Survey 2024–25 highlights trends, achievements, and challenges across major sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, industry, services, energy, information technology and telecommunications, capital markets, health, education, transport, and communication.

Meanwhile, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq approved the schedule for the upcoming sessions to present and discuss the federal budget for 2025–26.

According to the approved schedule, the budget will be presented in the National Assembly on June 10. The assembly would remain in recess on June 11 and 12, and the budget debate would commence on June 13.

If implemented,it could tilt the balance in favour of the landless. It is a politically contentious issue as some states see the move as Centre stepping into their domain.

The draft policy aims to ensure effective distribution of land to landless poor in a time-bound manner. It also aims protect them from losing their land,devise land use strategies and secure land rights for women.

However,since land is a state subject,the Centre can only advise. Therefore,a land reform policy would largely be a soft law or guidelines to states. The policy is part of the Agra Agreement with the Ekta Parishad signed in October 2012,following which a task force on land reforms was constituted.

The policy,which was circulated to task force members on Friday,also talks of giving homestead rights of at least 10 cents to the landless and homeless rural households. It urges states to have a more systematic plan for assignment of land to the poor while creating a land pool within a specified time frame.

According to the policy,states should distribute/assign/allot the available land to eligible land less poor,particularly the Scheduled Castes,Scheduled Tribes and other marginalised and deprived landless in a time-bound manner both for agriculture and house sites. The allotment of land should be made in the name of women member in the eligible family.

The policy advises states to draw up a land-use plan using modern scientific metho-dologies and taking into account development needs of the country while respecting the rights and opinions of the communities and the people.","The rural development ministry has prepared the draft National Land Reforms Policy, following the circulation of the draft National Right to Homestead Bill, 2013.

f8823221f88924d43d1e1fea9d62daae,"[DOC 1] Jaipur : Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday addressed the country’s top police and intelligence brass on the second day of the closed-door annual security conference in the pink city. While details of PM’s interaction with the officers were not immediately known, people familiar with the deliberations said the three-day conference is focused on diverse range of national security topics such as tackling new-age crimes such as cyber, identity related offences, misuse of technology by powers inimical for India’s growth, besides conventional challenges such as cross border terrorism and smuggling, terrorism and radicalization activities in the hinterland, left-wing extremism, etc.

Sessions also revolve around providing citizen-friendly policing services, nuclear, chemical and biological threats as well as demographic changes in border areas, the officials said.

Union home minister Amit Shah and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval are also attending the three-day conference, being held at Rajasthan International Centre (RIC).

Speaking at the inauguration on Friday, Shah had asked the director generals of police (DGPs) of all states and union territories (UTs) to train the officers in all ranks and upgrade technology in police stations for effective implementation of recently passed criminal laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Bharatiya Sakshya Bill (BSB), which replace the colonial-era Indian Penal Code (IPC), Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and the Indian Evidence Act. The Union home ministry is expected to notify the three bills by Republic Day.

An official who asked not to be named said the security of India’s borders is again a key topic like previous few years, since China’s attempts to change the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Galwan, Ladakh in 2020.

The PM and home minister are also likely to be apprised about the progress in security issues discussed during last year’s conference at PUSA institute in Delhi.

Last year, there were total 16 broad current and emerging security challenges such as managing influence of Chinese Commerical Entities (CCEs), which are engaged in Counter-Intelligence (CI) in India and China’s increasing influence in the neighborhood as well as rise in cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure, crypto currencies, implementation of 5G technology, issues of unfenced land borders, mass agitations, overstaying foreigners, radical organizations, Khalistani activities, and use of Interpol to achieve international cooperation that were discussed in Delhi conference.

On Modi’s discussions with the DGPs/IGPs and about 500 officers attending the conference in hybrid mode from across the country, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) is expected to issue a statement on Sunday.

Earlier, on Thursday, PMO said the conference will discuss “wide range of policing and internal security issues including cybercrime, technology in policing, counterterrorism challenges, left-wing extremism, prison reforms, among others”.

“Another key agenda of the conference is deliberations on the road map for implementation of the new criminal laws. Further, the conference will also deliberate on futuristic themes in policing and security like the challenges posed by new technologies such as AI, deepfakes, etc and ways to deal with them,” the PMO had said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a closed-door annual security conference in Jaipur, focusing on a wide array of national security challenges.

3bd55e44d4e7fb4010f9bd0c7e23e0ae,"[DOC 1] NAGPUR: In another example of its inefficiency, Nagpur University officials on Tuesday failed to inform the media about the actual number of students who were enrolled for the special examination to be conducted from August 28. August 14 was the deadline for enrolment of 6,616 ""illegally admitted"" students from 63 out of 250 banned colleges.
TOI had been trying to get details from the NU officials, right from pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande to exam controller Vilas Ramteke to media coordinator Shyam Dhond since then, but till date none of them have been able to furnish information about exact number of students enrolled, probably to shield the bogus students allegedly involved in the Rs 4.34 crore scholarship scam first exposed by TOI on August 10.
Even on Tuesday, Management Council expectedly cleared the amendments suggested by the Maharashtra government to its controversial ordinance (No. 6/2014) for conducting special examination. Those were to grant admission to these ""illegal"" students to second year directly without clearing first year exams. The members unanimously cleared them without bothering about how many students from 6,616 were actually going take admission. It would be now dispatched to chancellor K Sankaranarayanan for approval.
Deshpande and Dhond who had repeatedly assured TOI since Thursday that they would provide the exact number of students, who had enrolled for the special exams, were unable to do so even after five days. Ramteke also refused to speak citing registrar's gag orders and told the media to bring written permission from the VC. Dhond only stated that 48 colleges had submitted their list of students.
NU sources, however, revealed that there may not be more than 2,000 students who had actually enrolled, thus confirming doubts about the scholarship scam. They added that NU administration had unofficially extended deadline for submission of enrolment due to low turnout and apprehension that they would be exposed for extending undue benefits to the banned colleges, mostly controlled by the politicians and education barons.
Since the enrolment was to be made online, NU officials can inform about number of enrolled students at a click of a mouse. But NU was deliberately not disclosing their numbers before hearing on the banned colleges' case on Friday.
Deliberating on a major decision taken during council meeting, Dhond said that NU had appealed to the corporates to provide funds for a new multi-storied boys' hostel accommodating 200 inmates towards their corporate social responsibility (CSR) and they had received a positive response from a couple of companies. ""It will be either built at existing hostel at Law College square or at a new place at Rs 6.51 crore,"" he said.
He added that the discussion took place on 'gag' orders and no entry to the Exam Section for 'outsiders' imposed by the registrar on VC's instructions but the administration defended them.
Major decisions in council
* Construction of NU's administrative block should be started next week
* It should be completed within two years
* It will house technology, biodiversity and discovery parks
* E-tendering for any project above Rs 5 lakh for transparency
* Sericulture Department to be granted new space","Nagpur University officials failed to disclose the number of students enrolled for a special examination, part of an ongoing scholarship scam investigation. Despite media inquiries, officials provided no information, raising suspicions. The Management Council approved Maharashtra government's amendments, allowing ""illegally admitted"" students to directly enter the second year without passing the first year exams. The actual enrollment remains undisclosed. Sources suggest a possible extension of the enrollment deadline due to low turnout and concerns of exposing favoritism toward banned colleges. Additionally, the university seeks corporate funds for a new hostel and discusses 'gag' orders and restricted access in the Exam Section.

48cd9166da86e0e892e748bb76cf0aa8,"[DOC 1] India's Jio Financial Services is in early talks with merchant bankers for its maiden bond issue, four bankers told Reuters on Monday.

The company may look to raise ₹50 billion ($600.6 million) to ₹100 billion through the issue and may tap the market in the last quarter of this financial year, the bankers added.

Jio Financial, which was carved out of Reliance Industries, is in the process of getting its credit rating and other necessary approvals, they said.

The bankers declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media, while Jio Financial did not immediately reply to Reuters' email for comment.

The company, which was listed in August, plans to establish itself as a full-service financial services firm in a rapidly growing market, including auto, home loans and other products, competing with the likes of Bajaj Finance.

""Jio Financial has got a strong promoter parentage and it is expected that the company will automatically get AAA credit rating,"" said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap.

""While the pricing will depend on factors like tenor and balance sheet size of the company at the time of issue, being an NBFC, it will be 10-20 basis points higher than RIL.""

Earlier this month, Reliance Industries raised 200 billion rupees via 10-year bonds in the largest issue by a non-financial Indian firm, paying 40 basis points more than the government's borrowing cost.

Ahead of the bond issue, bankers have recommended that Jio Financial issue shorter-term commercial papers and put bank borrowing lines in places to establish pricing, said two bankers.

It has also been recommended to issue bonds not longer than five-year maturity, according to four bankers.

""Since the company is new, the documentation and compliance will take time, and we could see them coming in before end of March,"" a merchant banker with a private bank said.","
Jio Financial Services, an entity separated from Reliance Industries, is reportedly contemplating its debut bond offering, aiming to raise between ₹50 billion to ₹100 billion in the final quarter of the financial year. The company is preparing to secure credit ratings and necessary approvals for the issuance, targeting expansion into diverse financial sectors like auto loans and home finance, competing with major players such as Bajaj Finance in India's thriving financial market. Although details like pricing and tenor are subject to factors like the firm's balance sheet, being a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), Jio Financial may likely secure a AAA credit rating due to its strong promoter background, mentioned Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan from Rockfort Fincap. Ahead of the bond release, suggestions have been made for the company to issue shorter-term commercial papers and set up bank borrowing lines for establishing pricing, with recommendations for bond maturities not exceeding five years. However, due to expected documentation and compliance processes, the issuance may potentially occur before the end of March."

Water coolers and deep freezers have been provided at the border posts along the border outposts. Cool rooms have been made to bring down body temperature if any jawan is affected by heat. Jawans have been asked to go out only for important work. But for the cattle, birds and wildlife at the border areas, jawans are the only hope. They are providing water by keeping water pots and filling them regularly. BSF Rajasathan frontier DIG Ravi Gandhi said that at the border outposts water is being carried through water tankers and through these tankers even the small water ponds are filled for cattle along with water pots for birds.

Sriganganagar remained hottest in the state with a maximum temperature of 45.6 degrees Celsius, majority of other places witnessed rise in the early morning and day temperatures. Increased temperatures also increased the crisis of water and electricity. Jaipurites woke up to the hottest morning of the season so far with the minimum temperature of 30.8 degrees Celsius, almost 5 degrees above normal. There was no relief even in the afternoon as a maximum temperature of 43.8 degrees Celsius was recorded.
","Rajasthan, particularly along the international border, is facing severe heat wave conditions with temperatures soaring above 50 degrees Celsius. Despite this, BSF border guards are maintaining vigilance with precautions. Jawans are advised to carry lemon and onion, wear special goggles, and utilize water coolers and deep freezers provided at border posts. Cool rooms are available to lower body temperatures if heat affects them. Movement outside is restricted except for essential tasks. Additionally, jawans are ensuring water availability for cattle, birds, and wildlife by filling water pots and ponds. Sriganganagar recorded the highest temperature in the state at 45.6 degrees Celsius, exacerbating water and electricity shortages. Jaipur experienced its hottest morning of the season with a minimum temperature of 30.8 degrees Celsius, followed by a scorching afternoon reaching 43.8 degrees Celsius. The crisis underscores the need for precautionary measures and resource management amidst the extreme weather conditions."
760e1010f0661f73710a1ad8fb5813a1,"[DOC 1] The never-ending maternal question why are woman more likely than men to coo over babies  has finally been answered, claim boffins, who credit hormones for the loving tendency.
The study by St Andrews University researchers, who used computer images, found that women are able to determine a ""cute"" baby instinctively by its chubby cheeks, large forehead, big round eyes and button nose, reports the Sun.
Men, however, struggle to pick out the cutest baby from a selection of infant pictures.

The researchers say cuteness sensitivity is influenced by female reproductive hormones.

Dr Reiner Sprengelmeyer, of the university's school of psychology, said: We found that young women between 19-26 and 45-51 years were more sensitive to differences in infant cuteness than men aged 19-26 and 53-60 years.
Because average age at menopause is 51 years in the UK, these findings suggest the possible involvement of reproductive hormones in cuteness sensitivity.""","Researchers from St Andrews University claim that women are more likely than men to coo over babies due to their increased sensitivity to cuteness, influenced by female reproductive hormones.

c7640e3cd539e229c5f46bfbc9a131a9,"[DOC 1] Impressed by the successful conduction of the ongoing elections, observers from across the globe are here to examine the EVMs in action.
After three phases of successful execution of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), India goes to the third round of polls on Wednesday morning.
Impressed by the whole process, observers from various European as well as developing nations are here to examine the EVMs in action.


Gary Wintle, a Norwegian, has come to India to have the first hand understanding of how EVMs are employed at such a largescale. When he met the Election Commission (EC) authorities and sought to clear his doubts regarding the machine's safety, the authorities assured him that EVMs are foolproof and cannot be tampered with.

""The officials at the Election Commission clarified that since the whole exercise has built-in checks and balances at several levels, chances of abusing the machines are almost negligible,"" says Wintle (after securing explanations from the EC).

In the last two phases of polls held on April 20 and 26, according to EC, breakdown of around 70 EVMs out of 63,000 shows the success of this gadget in India.



The last parliamentary elections, held in 1999, used only ballot papers to register votes, which had spawned 25,00,000 ballot boxes and 8000 tonnes of ballot paper.

This time, the EVMs manufactured by two Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) — the Bharat Electronics Limited, Bangalore and the Electronic Corporation of India Limited, Hyderabad — are going to bring an end to the use of ballot papers in the country.

The EC authorities deny any loopholes in these machines. ""These machines have only be approved and being used after several dynamic tests were conducted,"" explains AN Jha, deputy secretary and spokesman of the Election Commission of India.

S Rangarajan, who was member of team, which devised EVMs in India, points out, ""The microchip used in EVMs is manufactured in US and it is sealed at the time of import. It cannot be opened and any rewriting of program can be done by anyone without damaging the chip. There is, therefore, absolutely no chance of programming the EVMs in a particular way to select any particular candidate or political party.""


Rangarajan, who is also a acclaimed journalist based in Chennai, describes, ""Above all, there is a master chip of each and every chip fitted in the EVMs and with the help of those any tampering can be detected, but, this will be in rarest of the case as EVMs are 100 per cent tamper proof.""

But, how safe is EVMs from the booth capturers, which is common phenomenon in the states like Bihar and UP? Explains Jha, ""By booth-capturing, if you mean, taking away or damaging of ballot boxes or ballot papers, then this foul cannot be barred by the use of EVMs as EVMs can also be forcibly taken away or broken by miscreants. But if one looks at booth capturing as a case of miscreants intimidating the polling personnel and stamping the ballot papers on the symbol and escaping in a matter of minutes, this can be prevented by the use of EVMs."" He explains that the EVMs are programmed in such a way that the machines will record only five votes in a minute. As recording of votes has necessarily to be through control unit and balloting unit, whatever be the number of miscreants they can record vote only at the rate of 5 per minute. In the case of ballot papers, the miscreants can distribute all the 1000 odd ballot papers assigned to a polling station, among themselves, stamp them, stuff
them into the ballot boxes and run away before the police reinforcements reach.


""In half-an–hour, the miscreants can record only a maximum of 150 votes by which time, chances are the police reinforcement would have arrived. Further, the presiding officer or one of the polling officers can always press the ‘close’ button as soon as they see some intruders inside the polling station. It will not be possible to record any vote when once the ‘close’ button is pressed and this will frustrate the efforts of the booth-capturers,"" Jha elaborates.

Technically, the EVMs have been designed such that it will take not less than 5 hours for the miscreants to poll the a maximum of 1500 votes at a polling station.

Political observers believe that EVMs will considerably diminish, if not eradicate, electoral malpractices in our country. They believe that since the machines can be used only once in 12 seconds and need to be reset before the next vote is cast. The machine will automatically switch off after every vote is cast. Even when workers of a political party ""capture"" a booth, they will realize it unmanageable to cast more than five votes in a single minute. That too is possible only with the support of polling officers.


At the end, the polling officer will also be able to testify any mishap or manipulation of the machines, which would lead to cancellation of polling at that booth, they explain. Since polling personnel will be drawn from different districts and at every booth 50 per cent of the poll personnel will be from other districts, it will be challenging for political parties to persuade all of them.

Many political leaders, who witnessed the detailed exposition of EVMs by the EC, have expressed their approval with the practice of the machines. CPI’s (Communist Party of India) D Raja believes that the EC should be commended for the use of EVMs at such a high magnitude. ""Voting by EVMs is easier compared to the conventional system, where one has to put the voting mark on or near the symbol of the candidate of his choice, fold it first vertically and then horizontally and thereafter put it into the ballot box. Where as in EVMs, the voter has to simply press the blue button against the candidate and symbol of his choice and the vote is recorded. Rural and illiterate people will have no problem in casting their votes,"" says Raja.


According to Bhartiya Janata Party’s Arun Jaitely, ""Now with this the counting will be rapid and the result can be declared within 2 to 3 hours as compared to 30-40 hours, on an average, under the conventional system.""

Also there will be no invalid votes under this system. Previously in every general election, the number of invalid votes was more than the winning margin between the winning candidate and the second candidate, in a number of constituencies. But now the preference of the electorate will be more correctly reflected when EVMs are used, Jaitely explains.

""After undergoing all kind of trials and researches, EVMs have been acknowledged by the Election Commission of India and till now no complaint against the system has cropped. We cannot assume that the EVMs can be tampered based on unjustifiable reports,"" expresses Rangarajan.


Earlier when the EVMs were first used in India two decades ago in the North Paravur Parliamentary by-elections in Kerala, the loser, A.C. Jose, challenged the result and the courts ordered a re-election but not on the grounds that EVMs were tampered with.","India’s ongoing elections have gained global attention, particularly for the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), which have impressed observers from Europe and developing nations. The Election Commission (EC) assures that EVMs are tamper-proof, with built-in checks preventing any misuse. The transition from paper ballots to EVMs has simplified the voting process and significantly reduced electoral malpractices, such as booth capturing. Political leaders and experts commend the system for its efficiency, speed, and accuracy in counting votes. EVMs are seen as a major step toward ensuring free and fair elections in India."

Employees walking in 30 minutes late or leaving their offices half an hour earlier could lose their half-day CL with the State government actively considering this measure to have punctuality and attendance.

Addressing a government function at Manan Kendra here on Tuesday, Chief Minister PS Golay pointed out that the Centre has recently notified that those Central government employees coming 15 minutes late or leaving 15 minutes earlier from their offices would see deduction of half-day CL.

“Why not in Sikkim also? If you all agree, let’s give a relaxation of 30 minutes. Henceforth, any government employees who reaches half an hour late or leaves half an hour earlier then why not we go for half CL? This is good for the public,” said the Chief Minister.

Reporting time in State government offices is 10 am and closing time is 4:30 pm.

Golay added that the State government is making provisions of ‘half CL’ for those reporting 30 minutes late or leaving 30 minutes earlier than scheduled time. This is for the good functioning of the government, he said, urging the department heads to be proactive on the strict adherence to punctuality and attendance.","In an effort to enforce punctuality and attendance among State government employees, Chief Minister PS Golay of Sikkim has proposed a new policy. Employees arriving 30 minutes late or departing 30 minutes early from their scheduled office hours may face the deduction of half a day's Casual Leave (CL). Golay highlighted that this measure aligns with recent actions taken by the Central government, which penalizes tardiness by deducting half-day CL for employees who are 15 minutes late or leave 15 minutes early.

Addressing a government function, Golay emphasized the importance of public service efficiency and proposed implementing the policy to enhance government functioning. Currently, office hours in State government offices run from 10 am to 4:30 pm.

29196e00b9bf14637d84bc22049bd19b,"[DOC 1] The Enforcement Directorate searched the offices of the former auditors of
IL&FS Financial Services (IFIN) on Wednesday, nearly three years after the federal
agency filed a money-laundering case over alleged financial irregularities at
Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) and its group companies.
The ED searched the Mumbai offices of Deloitte Haskins & Sells (DHS), the Indian
arm of Deloitte, and KPMG associate firm BSR & Co. DHS had rotated out as IFIN's
auditor in fiscal 2018,while BSR resigned from the role in June 2019 after
allegations of irregularities at the non-bank finance company came to light.
Other than the official premises, ED teams reached the residence of two partners who had signed off on the audit reports - Udayan Sen, who has since retired from Deloitte, and N Sampath Ganesh of BSR - and questioned them about the processes and methodologies followed in the audits. At least three agencies - the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), Income Tax department and the ED - are probing the NBFC. The ED carried out the searches days after the government notified changes to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, bringing practicing chartered accountants, company secretaries and cost and works accountants carrying out financial transactions on behalf of their clients into the ambit of the anti-money-laundering law.
""There are certain audit irregularities that have been found in the books of IFIN and this requires clear explanation from the auditors. Searches were conducted as a part of the investigation into the case to ascertain their roles,"" said an official privy to the investigation.
When asked if the raids were linked to the recent notification, the official said since such searches were deemed as procedures in ongoing investigations, the agency could always go with the assumption that the notification was retrospective in nature, unless challenged legally in the future stages of the probe.
""Also, the said probe is underway and not yet closed by the agency, so the question of whether the notification has been applied retrospectively will be a question taken up by the adjudicating authority or the courts,"" the official explained, adding: ""The notification strengthens the ED to probe the role of those who audited the books and also bring them under the ambit of a money-laundering probe.""
According to officials in the know, ED's teams reached Deloitte's office at Indiabulls Finance Centre in Lower Parel and KPMG's office at Nesco Center, Goregaon early morning and started quizzing the audit teams. They also recorded the statements of the professionals involved in auditing IFIN, the officials said.
A Deloitte spokesperson said: ""This routine inquiry is in respect to an ongoing matter regarding a former client and we continue to extend our full cooperation to authorities A KPMG statement said it has co-operated and provided all necessary support to ED.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) searched the offices of Deloitte Haskins & Sells and KPMG associate firm BSR & Co. in Mumbai, investigating alleged financial irregularities at IL&FS Financial Services (IFIN).

The searches followed recent changes to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which now includes auditors. Officials stated the searches are part of an ongoing probe to ascertain the auditors' roles, with both Deloitte and KPMG cooperating fully."

7628c3009e7ec0922a680748e77d9b78,"[DOC 1] In yet another tragic incident that sent shockwaves around the national capital and beyond, 20-year-old Yash Kumar was brutally stabbed and murdered in East Delhi’s Geeta Colony. It is being said that Yash was killed in a road-rage incident after one of the accused, a juvenile, got into an argument with Yash after the latter’s scooter brushed past the minor, and the matter escalated when two associates of the minor and Yash’s cousin got into the scuffle.

During the scuffle, the three accused started chasing Yash and his cousin and one of the accused, Muhammad Amaan, stabbed Yash in the lower back. And even though Yash was rushed to a nearby hospital, he succumbed to his injuries.

At this juncture, it is of utmost importance to note that whenever a Hindu is murdered by a group of Muslims, the ‘road-rage’ trope is repeated every single time. But why is it that in every case, the Hindu is the one who is murdered, and only the Hindu’s vehicle brushes past the Muslim(s)?

In order to get to the deeper truth of the case, Sonakshi Datta of GoaChronicle got in touch with Hindu Activist Bittu Bajrangi, who met with Yash’s family, and talked about the real truth, hidden under the garb of the ‘road-rage’ storyline.

Speaking about the matter, Bajrangi said, ‘Out of the three accused, two are Muslims and one is a Hindu. One of the Muslim accused and his Muslim friends had earlier had an argument with Yash on the day of Eid, that revolved around Yash being friends with a Muslim girl, who was also friends with the accused.’

‘The Muslim accused were involved in illegal activities like extortion, police officers in Delhi told me. For quite some time before Yash got killed, the Muslims wanted to achieve something like this, but they couldn’t earlier, as all of them lived in the same colony. The scooter brushing past and the road-rage was a mere pretext’, revealed Bajrangi.


As per the updates given by police officials, arms were also recovered from the Muslim accused, which they were carrying with them while killing Yash, but he was ultimately stabbed with a knife.

On speaking with Yash’s bereaved family members, it was also known that the Muslims in the area have been threatening them, saying, ‘We have only killed your son till now, but you would be killed too.’

The family members and Yash’s cousin involved in the scuffle, Aman Sharma, also revealed how it completely seemed like a pre-planned attack, as four-five people had surrounded Yash and it was the accused who brushed against their scooter.

Based on the recordings of these threats and the danger against Yash’s cousin’s life, Bittu Bajrangi did his part, submitted the evidence to the police and administration, and now, Yash’s home is being guarded by two police personnel for security provision.

The three accused, including the juvenile, are currently under police remand, and a case under Section 103 (Murder) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, has been filed against the accused, Muhammad Amaan and Lucky.","A tragic road-rage incident in East Delhi’s Geeta Colony led to the death of 20-year-old Yash Kumar, who was fatally stabbed after a minor scuffle allegedly turned violent. According to initial reports, the altercation began when Yash’s scooter brushed past a juvenile, escalating into a chase and violent attack involving three individuals. Yash was stabbed in the back and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital.

However, deeper concerns have surfaced about the true motive behind the incident. Activist Bittu Bajrangi, after meeting Yash's family, claimed the incident was not a spontaneous road-rage case, but a pre-planned attack—linked to past tensions between the victim and one of the Muslim accused, possibly due to Yash's friendship with a Muslim girl.

The victim's family alleges ongoing threats from local individuals and fears for their safety, leading to police providing them security. Arms were reportedly recovered from the accused, further raising concerns that the attack may have been organized in advance.

The police have arrested all three accused, including a juvenile, and charged them under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The case has ignited broader questions about communal tensions and safety in urban neighborhoods, and stirred debate on whether such incidents are being too easily dismissed as “road rage.”"
1706591f600f78996dc590b2fec6bde3,"[DOC 1] New Delhi : With parts of Delhi seeing maximum temperatures in excess of 49 degrees Celsius (°C) on Sunday, two questions are uppermost on peoples’ minds: is 50 possible; and is the climate crisis behind this?

The answers, according to experts, is that 50°C is indeed possible; and that the climate crisis is likely responsible for what is happening. In fact, it may be the new normal.

On Sunday, parts of Delhi recorded maximum temperatures over 49°C but many other parts of northwest India also burned. Banda in Uttar Pradesh recorded 49°C; Gurugram, Hisar and Narnaul in Haryana; and Khajuraho and Nowgong in Madhya Pradesh recorded maximum temperatures of over 47°C. And people should get used to these, suggested an expert.

“This is the new normal and it will remain so for years to come. Maximum temperatures during heatwave periods over northwest India have already gone up from 45-46°C to 47-48°C. With climate change, we are going to see three things with heatwaves: higher intensity; an increase in duration from, say, 5 days to 7-8 days at a stretch; and a larger impact area,” said M Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences.

The bad news: all three are already evident.

To be sure, there were exceptional events this year that contributed to the heatwave, but these could have still been caused by the climate crisis. Among these: a prolonged dry spell (northwest India and central India recorded 78% and 58% rainfall deficiency during the pre-monsoon season so far that started on March 1) ; and very few western disturbances that bring pre-monsoon rain to northwest India, resulting in clear skies and very high solar radiation.

“The atmospheric conditions were peculiar this year. There was an area of high pressure which formed in March and was centered around Gujarat. It persisted in April, leading to incursion of dry and hot northwesterlies inwards. There was an early spring as the westerly jet moved northward and led to a reduction in western disturbances that normally bring thunderstorms and some rain to the region. Clear skies due to lack of rains finally created conditions for an unprecedented heatwave spell. And in May, when severe cyclone Asani was weakening, it was also dragging northwesterly winds bringing hot, dry winds inward. Now again, hot northwesterlies are prevailing over the region. During La Nina years, we do not expect such heatwaves but this year is exceptional,” said DS Pai, director at the Institute of Climate Change Studies, government of Kerala and former IMD scientist.

La Nina, a cold current in the Pacific, is associated with relatively cooler summers in India.

Pai adds that he would term this year an “exception” but admits that “new areas” are now seeing these “high temperatures” and that “urbanisation creates pockets of extremely high temperatures”.

The science

The World Weather Attribution (WWA) network, a global collaboration of leading climate scientists who work on analysing whether a particular extreme weather event is linked to the climate crisis, will submit findings of their study on this year’s spring heatwave in India and Pakistan (in March and April) within the next fortnight.

WWA scientists Sarah Kew and Robert Vautard said during a recent workshop that there is only a one in a 100 chance of such a heatwave occurring every year, stressing that the event was rare because of the very large area that was affected ; the long duration of the heatwave spell; and very early onset of the heatwave during the spring season. The scientists said the spell affected all of northwest India, central India and even parts of east India. Vautard said even though the 2022 heatwave was unusual with return period of the order of 100 years, such events are occurring more often and its alright to expect unbelievable extreme weather events.

“The temperatures that formerly constituted ‘extreme’ are now just unusual. And temperatures which were previously all but impossible are the new definition of extreme. Crucially, the change of likelihood happens fastest for the most extreme temperatures…an increase of 1ºC in global temperature therefore makes heatwaves more than 1ºC hotter,” WWA said in a recent guide last week on ‘Reporting extreme weather and climate change.’ WWA cited an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report from 2021 that said a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over ten years and be 1.2°C hotter. At 2°C of global warming, it will occur 5.6 times and be 2.6°C hotter. Similarly, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 50 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 4.8 times over 50 years and be 1.2°C hotter. At 2°C of global warming, it will occur 13.9 times and be 2.7°C hotter.

Urbanisation

On Sunday, Mungeshpur and Najafgarh, both heavily built-up areas saw among the highest temperatures in Delhi. “There will be pockets in cities which record extremely high temperatures because of the urban heat island effect. Mungeshpur and Najafgarh are automatic weather stations and we do not have long-term data for these to see the climate change footprint. To understand climate change impacts, we should always see the data for Safdarjung and Palam stations which recorded 45°C to 46°C yesterday. Of course, the imprint of climate crisis on heatwave spells is obvious but let’s not discount the effect of urbanisation, population density etc,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. Most experts believe both urbanisation and population density are factors that contribute to the climate crisis.","Delhi witnessed scorching temperatures exceeding 49°C, raising concerns about the possibility of hitting 50°C and the role of climate change. Experts confirm that such extreme heat is now part of the “new normal,” driven by climate change. Factors like prolonged dry spells, fewer western disturbances, and high-pressure systems contributed to the heatwave. Scientists warn that climate change is intensifying heatwaves in terms of intensity, duration, and affected areas. Urbanisation and the ""urban heat island"" effect have worsened local conditions, particularly in densely built-up areas like Najafgarh and Mungeshpur. The World Weather Attribution network is studying the spring heatwave’s link to climate change, but initial data already suggest that extreme temperatures, once rare, are becoming more frequent and intense."

Party leader P. Jayarajan remained tight-lipped about Mr. Thomas’ accusations at a district secretariat meeting on Saturday. When approached by mediapersons, Mr. Jayarajan responded that the accusations held more significance for the media than for him.

CPI(M) Kannur district secretary M.V. Jayarajan also refused to address the issue.

Reports indicate that several district secretariat members criticised P. Jayarajan for worsening the situation through his Facebook post, which came after the district secretary had addressed the media.

Mr. Thomas had accused party leaders of liaison with criminal groups, alleging that P. Jayarajan frequently put the party in crisis and used his influence for personal gain, implicating his son Jain P. Raj in illegal activities.

Meanwhile, a statement from the CPI(M) district secretariat said the party condemned ongoing media narratives linking it to criminal groups, labelling the accusations as baseless and misleading. Party leaders refuted claims that State committee member P. Jayarajan and district committee member M. Shajar were aiding such groups.

The district secretariat urged party members and the public to remain vigilant against these false narratives. They said Mr. Thomas’ allegations, shared widely on social media, were unfounded and objectionable.

The CPI(M) reiterated its commitment to mobilising labour and peasant masses, fighting against injustice, and opposing corporate and racist policies. It accused right-wing parties and certain media outlets of attempting to undermine the party’s credibility following recent election losses, urging the public to see through the misinformation campaigns.

Meanwhile, Jain P. Raj, through his lawyer, issued a legal notice to Mr. Thomas, demanding a retraction of the allegations, a public apology, and compensation of ₹50 lakh. Mr. Raj contended that Mr. Thoma falsely linked him to a gold-mining gang, quotation gangs, and illegal businesses.","Manu Thomas, removed from the CPI(M) Kannur district committee, has accused party leaders of criminal associations and misconduct.

Mukherjee,who previously served as the Finance Minister,noted that the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17) has envisaged a growth rate of 9 per cent per year and said such scales of economic expansion need several enabling factors prominent among them being education. Spelling out the measures that need to be taken to push the country on the path of growth,he said,Innovation is a key managerial strategy for growth.The President said emphasis must be laid on various dimensions of innovation,such as process innovation,product innovation,business model innovation and new technology innovation. Underlining that strong capabilities in designing and building machine tools are particularly critical,he said the industry must develop close partnerships with universities and research institutions to take this aspiration forward. Mukherjee highlighted that the contribution of manufacturing to total employment in India is about 11 per cent,which is lower than that of many emerging countries where the share of manufacturing in total employment is between 15 to 30 per cent. The National Manufacturing Policy,2011 has envisaged the creation of 100 million additional jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2025,he said,adding it is expected that share of manufacturing in GDP will increase to 25 per cent by 2022. To make Indian industry productive and competitive,we must enhance our capabilities on many fronts,primarily human skill,hardware technology,and knowledge base. People should be at the heart of the engineering effort,reaching out to human resources,consumers and vendors, he said. I strongly believe that there is another milestone to be crossed in the quality and productivity journey. New operating models would need to be considered such as flexible automation,multi-location production,deferred customization and disposable factories, the President said.","President Mukherjee is optimistic about India's economic growth despite the recent slowdown. He believes the country has the potential to achieve the 12th Plan target of 9% growth with focus on education and innovation. He emphasized the importance of strong partnerships between industry, universities, and research institutions for technological advancement. He also highlighted the need to improve human skills, hardware technology, and knowledge base to make Indian industry more productive and competitive."

Kerala Story' keeping in view the law and order situation and to ""maintain peace""
in the state and avoid any incidents of crime and violence, people in the know told
ET. West Bengal becomes the first state in the country to ban the screening of the
movie. All screenings in Kolkata and all district theatres have been cancelled
following the direction of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
""What is this Kerala Story? I don't support CPM (government in Kerala). I am
talking about the people. But the Kerala government should have protested
against it. Instead of me, it was their duty to protest. Why are they silent?"" Banerjee said at state secretariat Nabanna on Monday. She alleged that the CPM government of Kerala is working with the BJP.
""Kerala story...it is a distorted story. Now they are defaming Kerala state and giving their narrative. What was the purpose
of this 'Kashmir Files'? It is to humiliate one section of people,"" Banerjee said. Banerjee also claimed that ""the BJP was allegedly funding a film on Bengal on the lines of 'Kashmir Files'.

The movie had sparked a controversy as it is centred about the alleged religious indoctrination in Kerala and how Hindu and Christian women were being targeted by radical Islamic clerics. The movie claims that these women were converted to Islam and later sent to countries like Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria ""to fight for the cause of Islam"".

Banerjee has directed state chief secretary HK Dwivedi to ensure the film is removed from screens throughout the state. This comes a day after multiplexes across Tamil Nadu cancelled screenings of the controversial film from Sunday, citing law and order issues and poor public response.","West Bengal has become the first state to ban the film *The Kerala Story* due to concerns over law and order. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee criticized the film as a distorted portrayal aimed at defaming Kerala and alleged collusion between the CPM government in Kerala and the BJP.

The shooting, which resulted in four deaths and nine injuries, has ignited fierce debate over gun control and school safety.

During a rally in Arizona on Thursday, Vance described school shootings as a grim ""fact of life"" and criticized Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for her gun control stance. ""Now look, the Kamala Harris answer to this is to take law-abiding citizens’ guns away from them,"" Vance remarked. He further stated, “I don’t like this. I don’t like to admit this. I don’t like that this is a fact of life.”
Vance suggested that increasing security at schools is the only viable solution, albeit reluctantly. “We’ve got to bolster security so that if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children, they’re not able to,” he said. His fatalistic view has drawn criticism for being dismissive of the root causes of gun violence and overly simplistic.

The Harris campaign seized on Vance’s comments, with Harris herself posting a rebuttal on X (formerly Twitter). “School shootings are not just a fact of life,” she wrote. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can take action to protect our children – and we will.”


Vance’s remarks were also scrutinized for their inconsistency. He admitted that he doesn’t support increased security around schools for his own children, yet he proposed it as a nationwide solution. “As a parent, do I want my school to have additional security? No, of course I don’t,” Vance conceded.
The controversy has also drawn reactions from other political figures. Tim Walz, Governor of Minnesota and Harris’s running mate, described Vance’s comments as “pathetic” and emphasized the need for better protection for children.


In contrast, Trump addressed the shooting at a Fox News town hall, emphasizing a need for societal healing without directly engaging with policy specifics. “It’s a sick and angry world for a lot of reasons and we’re going to make it better,” Trump said.","JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, faces backlash for his remarks on the Apalachee High School shooting in Georgia, calling such incidents a ""fact of life"" and advocating for increased school security instead of gun control. His comments were criticized as dismissive and inconsistent, particularly as he opposed extra security for his own children. Kamala Harris, his opponent, countered that school shootings need not be inevitable, advocating for protective action."
de3844a8d9e15c67495f897e25e5a487,"[DOC 1] A frenzied growth in India’s equity options market, which clocked a record 85 billion trades last year and accounted for 84 per cent of all equity option contracts traded in 2023, is unnerving policymakers and regulators. Apart from the investment surge, the worries for policymakers are twin pronged: that the most traded equity-index options in India are risky short-dated contracts and retail investors now make up over 35 per cent of options trades, undeterred by the fact that 9 out of 10 individual traders in the equity futures and options (F&O) segment are recorded to have incurred losses.

Designed originally as a tool for hedging risk, derivatives instruments such as can be options have traditionally played second fiddle to equities. Index options, for instance, are generally used to wager bets on the future direction of a benchmark index, such as the NSE, for a small fee. Equity-index options give the holder the right to buy an index at a specified price, called the strike price, when the contract expires at a future data. If the index were to climb higher than the strike when the contract expires, the holder makes money. Else, they lose the cost of the options, called the premium, which is generally a small amount. The problem, though, is that shorter dated contracts, which are clear favourites among Indian investors, are generally more risky. Plus, the investment flows coming in from the retail segment makes matters worse. The NSE is where most of the action is concentrated, which handles over 90 per cent of all equity options transactions.

That the Nifty 50, the NSE’s benchmark index, has been hovering around its lifetime high has helped the options boom. Not surprising that the Exchange, in a circular dated April 23, said that it is not considering imposing transaction charges for F&O contracts on Nifty Next 50 Index that was to be applicable since launch on April 24,2024. “In order to encourage active participants in Futures and Options contracts on Nifty Next 50 Index, it has been decided that no transaction charges will be levied on the trades done in Futures and Options contracts on Nifty Next 50 Index (NIFTYNXT50) in Future & Options segment from April 24, 2024 (product launch date) till October 31, 2024″, the NSE said in its circular.

Last year, Indian investors traded 85 billion options ­contracts, more than anywhere else in the world, having overtaken the US in the volume of annual trades just before the pandemic. The exponential growth is evident in the numbers, Stock options contracts surging 138 per cent in turnover in three years and index options up 425 per cent. There are multiple enablers. A top CIO at a leading MF said that changes made to the contract structures over the last few years, alongside easier onboarding and interface of the new generation trading apps has triggered a “gamification of this market”. This, in tandem with what he called a “sachetisation” of options, has attracted a younger demographic as well as clients from Tier II and III cities. “There is a segment of people who are chasing futures and options, and they are unlikely to make money on a consistent basis,” Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company, told The Indian Express in an interview.

Mumbai-based Upstox, a new age broking firm, is pitching ready-made options strategies as curated meal combos for the financial market while Bangalore-based Zerodha propounds option as an investor tool for “protecting your position and reducing risk” with the claim that “statistically, the option seller has a higher odd of winning in a typical option contract”. A band of so-called finfluencers are on an overdrive to lure investors to the risky and complex options trading. In India retail investors now make up 35 per cent of options trades, undeterred by the fact that 9 out of 10 individual traders — in the equity F&O segment incurred losses. And new age online brokerages promise to help investors “trade options like a pro using ready-made strategies” that involve what the brokerage claims are “ready-made option strategies”, described as “curated meal combos for the financial market”.

The issue of increasing retail investor exposure has been flagged at the level of the markets regulator and actively discussed by officials in North Block, where there are concerns about a build-up of a bubble, coming at a time when there is already some unease over the small and mid-cap investments by retail participants and another round of irrational crypto exuberance is anticipated.

While derivatives volumes now account for 5-15 times their cash market volumes in most western markets, it’s more than 400 times higher than that of underlying cash market today in India, a steep rise from three times in 2010, according to the top fund manager with a private fund house.

“Change in contract structure, leverage combined with the ease of onboarding and interface of the new generation trading apps has triggered gamification of this market with number of active derivatives traders jumping 8 times to 4 million from less than 0.5 million in 2019,” he says. In comparison, in the cash market, the number has grown 3 times — from 3 million in 2019 to 11 million.

Though the NSE cautioned investors not to subscribe to any such scheme/product offered by any person offering indicative/ assured/ guaranteed returns in the stock market as the same is prohibited by law, investors are still being lured by false promises. Operators and broking firms encourage retail investors to build up options positions through Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram channels, promising assured returns. Derivative trading – futures and options – in the stock market is clearly not for individual traders, if a study by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is any indication.

As many as 89 per cent of the individual traders — 9 out of 10 individual traders — in the equity F&O segment incurred losses with an average loss of Rs 1.1 lakh during FY22, Sebi warned in the study. Further, 90 per cent of the active traders incurred average losses of Rs 1.25 lakh during the same period, the regulator cautioned. According to the Sebi, for the group of active traders (excluding outliers), on an average, loss makers registered net trading loss close to Rs 50,000 in FY22. For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), the average loss of a loss maker was over 15 times the average profit by a profit maker during FY22.

While options trading, a form of a derivative contract that gives buyers of the contracts (the option holders) the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a stock or index at a predetermined price at some point in the future, is generally seen as safer form of investment where upside risks are capped, the complexity of derivative instruments such as options and futures make it somewhat unsuitable for general retail investment.","the most traded equity-index options in India are risky short-dated contracts. retail investors now make up 35 per cent of options trades, undeterred by the fact that 9 out of 10 individual traders in the equity futures and options segment incurred losses. the issue of increasing retail investor exposure has been flagged at the level of the markets regulator."
7696382bed03d853b82ad6e6541deec8,"[DOC 1] Hyderabad: The site on which the Osmania University campus is situated did not meet with the approval of Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam VII, founder of the university. He agreed to it very reluctantly. The Nizam wanted the university to be situated in the heart of the city, on the banks of River Musa (Musi) and near the High Court, according to documents in Urdu preserved in the state archives, Mohammed Abdul Raqeeb, assistant director, Telangana State Archives and Research Institute, told Deccan Chronicle.

The search committee could not find the required land and zeroed in on Adikmet, which was then on the city’s outskirts. The Nizam was not impressed and asked them to continue the search but when it became obvious that 1,400 acres in the vicinity of the High Court was simply not to be had, the Nizam reluctantly settled for the Adikmet land. The State Archives houses many such interesting documents including firmans in Urdu/Persian, pertaining to the building designs, selection of land, construction of the university and allocation of funds. It also has a collection of rare photographs, says Zareena Praveen, director of the institute. Farmans are royal orders, and those issued in the Asaf Jahi period, including those of the sixth Nizam, Mir Mahboob Ali Khan, and Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam, from 1901 to 1950, have been preserved in the State Archives. They are in Persian and Urdu.

There is a hukm dated April 26, 1917, which established the university in Hyderabad and named it Osmania University, with Urdu as the main language and English as a compulsory subject. Another hukm dated July 17, 1919, granted approval for the monogram with “Ain”, an Arabic alphabet, in the centre, and the state colour of yellow. A letter written by Rabindranath Tagore, dated January 9, 1918, is among the documents in the archives. There is a firman to academicians who were preparing the syllabus the university was to follow that insisted that nothing should be published which hurts religious sentiment of people and creates a rift in society.

","The Osmania University campus in Hyderabad, established by Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam VII, was initially not the Nizam's preferred location. He wanted the university near the High Court and the River Musa, but due to land unavailability, he reluctantly accepted the Adikmet site. The Telangana State Archives houses many historical documents, including firmans (royal orders) in Urdu and Persian, which detail the university's establishment, land selection, construction, and funding.

aceb0858d245e647cfce9156a9b73b72,"[DOC 1] The order from the Nagaland Food Safety Commissioner banning storage and sale of formalin treated fish notwithstanding, more formalin laced fish was detected in Dimapur on June 28.  

The contaminated fish were detected at 6 locations from retailers. After camping in Kohima the past few days, the lone Mobile Food Safety Laboratory made the rounds today in Dimapur under the supervision of Food Safety officials.  

Over 900 kgs of imported fish were collected from New Market, Railway Bazaar, District Jail junction (NH 36), Duncan Basti and Chumukedima. It mostly included the popular rohu, catla, pami and pankhaj species. Samples were analysed at the Mobile Lab by chemists from the State Public Health Laboratory, Kohima.  

Food Safety Officer (FSO), Sendong Jamir informed that the samples from the daily markets tested positive for formalin. Of the fish collected from Railway Bazaar, the FSO said that 4 samples out of five (different varieties) tested positive. The contaminated fish were impounded for disposal.  

Representatives from the Dimapur Urban Council Chairmen Union (DUCCF) and GBs Union Dimapur (Sadar) also met the DMC Administrator, Veterinary Department and district Food Safety officials.  

Earlier in the morning, Food Safety personnel alongwith the district administration visited the main fish distribution & auction site at Sema Tilla to collect samples from the main supply point. However, no stock was available as supply has stopped since the report of formalin contamination hit the news, the FSO informed.  

Nevertheless, the Food Safety personnel went around the town checking daily markets, and samples collected from retailers.  

DUCCF chairman, Tsenthungo Lotha asserted that the government must strictly implement the order till all contaminated fish is confiscated and destroyed. While maintaining that the government must ensure the import of safe fish and other food products, he added that the consumers should also report to the authorities when corrupt food items are detected or suspected of contamination.  

Question of how and where?

The laboratory analyses thus far have returned ‘positive results’. A bigger question though is how and where or at what point?  

None of the local fish traders as well as the authorities, have been able to provide a suitable explanation till date.  

According to Abdul Malik, a fish wholesaler, the bulk of the fish are sourced from Andhra Pradesh, Kolkata and Assam. He said that some 20-30 tonnes of fish reach Dimapur daily by road, a portion of which also go to Peren, Kohima, Phek, Wokha and even Imphal. Quoting retail vendors, he said that around 5-6 tonnes are sold daily in Dimapur.  

The fish are boxed in ice-filled styrofoam containers, which are sealed at source, to be unsealed only after reaching the destination. He added that the sealed ice box normally lasts ten days, while the road journey from Andhra Pradesh to Dimapur takes 5-6 days.  

“The distributors procure it in bulk from the source. They distribute it to the wholesalers, who in turn auction it to the retailers.” He added that if there is any tampering of the seal midway, it can be physically detected.  

Malik said that till the “allegation” is not cleared the distributors will withhold procurement and sale, while adding that supply has stopped since June 26.  

He further contested that the authorities have yet to give them copies of the test results of the samples collected earlier this month.  

“We have also taken our own samples and have sent it for independent laboratory analysis in Guwahati. We’re expecting the test results soon,” he informed.  

Manzar Alam, who identified himself as an employee of one of the main distributors, held that the authorities should also give them copies of the earlier test results. “They have collected samples from us 2-3 times. They are saying it is positive but we have yet to witness with our own eyes the test results till date. If only they would give us the laboratory report, we’d get back to the suppliers at source and act accordingly,” he maintained.  

Reports of the tests of the samples collected today were however given to the wholesalers as well as retail vendors and also to the district administration.","Despite a ban on formalin-treated fish, more contaminated fish was found in Dimapur. Over 900 kgs were collected from six locations, with samples testing positive for formalin. Local authorities, including the Food Safety Officer and urban council representatives, discussed strict implementation of the ban. Fish traders expressed concerns over the source of contamination and demanded access to test results. Distribution has halted since June 26. Wholesalers are awaiting independent lab results. The lack of clarity on test results and the need for transparent communication between authorities and distributors remain unresolved issues."
bc2bebffbc7c4fb1762bc7a6f266934a,"[DOC 1] The state government is altering the age to enter school. A child now, for admission to nursery in 2024/25, will need to be at least 3 years old by the time he or she enters school.
While admissions have begun, the state is drawing up a policy to ensure that admission norms are in line with the NEP 2020 rules. Until now, a child in Maharashtra who completed 3 years by December was permitted to join nursery, so many children who were 2.5 years old also joined nursery. No longer now.
""We are working on a new age policy for admission. We will soon declare it, and it will be applicable for the academic year 2024/25. Age criteria are being revised to 3 years by the time students enter school. The new policy is being drawn up in collaboration with the women and child development ministry, which handles the anganwadis,"" said Sharad Gosavi, state director, primary education.
Meanwhile, the Early Childhood Association has demanded that the state government alter the entry age for toddlers entering nursery.

The ECA has written to Governor Ramesh Bais and asked him to intervene and ask the state government to declare three years as the minimum age for entering kindergarten. Following the National Education Policy (NEP 2020), ECA members stated that Maharashtra is among the only few states to not have altered the entry age, because of which there are many children reaching grade 1 at the age of 5 or 5.2 years.

“Attending nursery before the age of 3 years will leave a deep negative impact on children in the long term. Curricula designed for nursery are in line with well-researched developmental abilities of a 3-year-old child. However, children younger than 3 may struggle to cope,” said ECA president Swati Popat Vats. The present Maharashtra government resolution requires that the child should have completed three years by December 31. “But schools begin in April or June, and this means that children are 2.5 years old when they begin nursery and 5.5 when they are in grade one,” she added.


“The entry age is getting younger. Kids who ought to be in playgroup are in nursery. There are examples around the world where kids join school at an older age and joining early is doing good to no one,” said Parveen Shaikh, principal, The Somaiya School. “There has to be an alignment between what the state says and what is recommended in the NEP. Older kids whose minds are more developed are more ready to be at a new place, understand the teacher, connect with what is being taught.”

Recently, Karnataka also altered the minimum age for entering school to 3 years. “On paper, it looks like a small period of 3-6 months, but in the life of a child that young, those few months can have a lifelong impact. Both the NEP and the RTE indicate the right admission age as 6 years for grades 1 and 3 years for preschool, respectively,” added Vats.


Educationists explained that if a two-and-a-half-year-old started nursery, the 6-month gap at that age matters in language, social development, emotional development, etc. “For example, 2.5-year-olds are able to use sentences of 2-3 words and say ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘me’. At three years, toddlers can usually use sentences of 3-5 words, or even more. At 2.5 they are not able to take turns, a required skill in preschool. By 3, toddlers start learning how to take turns when speaking and have a short conversation with you,” said Vats.","Maharashtra is revising its school admission age policy, aligning with NEP 2020, requiring children to be at least 3 years old by school entry in 2024/25. The Early Childhood Association urges a minimum age of 3 for kindergarten entry, emphasizing developmental impacts. Karnataka has also adjusted entry age. Educationists stress the significance of this age gap in language and social development."

Sources said the incumbent VC, Varun Sahni, was still trying hard to get his term extended. Sahni had been granted special permission to conduct interviews till his term ended, the sources claimed.

A JU teacher, on condition of anonymity, said: “There is an air of uncertainty in the university as only one week is left for Professor Sahni to complete his term but the selection committee has not yet announced any names. Teaching staff are having apprehensions about decisions on pending issues concerning their promotions, postings or extensions.”

The postponement of the interviews for departmental promotions of the teaching staff, which were scheduled for November 29, was also disturbing, he added.

Another senior professor at JU revealed, “The teaching staff are given promotions under the Career Advancement Scheme (CAS). Even as the assessment work for the CAS was done and the interviews were scheduled for November 29 and 30, the sudden suspension of the same has created a worrisome situation.”

“The aspirants were happy because the assessment work, which is the biggest hurdle, was over. But now they are worried because they do not know whether this assessment criteria will hold good with the new VC.”

“Earlier the selection committee had expedited the search process but as Professor Sahni’s term is nearing culmination, they have maintained silence. Such delays are never good for any institution as they give space to speculations and dispirit the employees,” he added.

The other question doing the rounds is whether the new VC will be a local. The officials here are divided over the matter, but the majority want a non-local VC. “A local has already been appointed as VC of the Central University of Jammu. So, appointing another local at JU will set a wrong precedent,” said a professor from the JU administration.","Speculation is growing about the appointment of the new Vice-Chancellor at the University of Jammu as the term of the current VC, Varun Sahni, is set to end on December 8, and the selection committee has not yet announced a successor.

Addressing the media, he charged the Kejriwal government with having completely failed in controlling the increasing pollution level and said the apathy of the government has resulted into Delhi becoming “a capital of dust”.

“The chief minister is only interested in political expansion of his party that has led to the worsening overall situation in the city where most of the people are compelled to live in miserable conditions,” he added.

Citing reports by some medical experts, he said corona pandemic would not have taken a monstrous turn in Delhi had air pollution been under control. “If people are suffering from lung cancer, heart disease, asthma, TB, it is Kejriwal who is responsible for all this,” he said.

Extensively quoting from an NGO’s Greenpeace Southeast Asia report, he said 54,000 people died of pollution-related diseases in the capital last year alone or a daily average of 148 deaths and it caused a monetary loss of Delhi to the tune of Rs 58,000 crore.

Talking about the Green budget of the Kejriwal government, Gupta said even on stubble burning, he made a lot of hue and cry, but figures show last year the government spent only Rs 40,000 in buying bio decomposer units while Rs 24 lakh was spent on their distribution and another whopping Rs 9 crore on its publicity.","Delhi BJP President, Adesh Gupta, criticized the Delhi Government for allegedly spending only 1.6% of the Rs 883 crore collected as green cess to control pollution.

5a8ebd4f42a2ad5124d94c54b866c6ee,"[DOC 1] Due to climate change, the world experienced an average of 41 more days of extreme heat in 2024, a new report said on Friday (December 27, 2024). According to the European climate agency Copernicus, 2024 is set to end as the warmest year on record and the first year with a global average temperature 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

A yearly review report by two groups of climate scientists — World Weather Attribution (WWA) and Climate Central — said the world saw an average of 41 more days of dangerous heat in 2024. Small island developing states were hit the hardest, with their people experiencing over 130 additional hot days.

The scientists identified 219 extreme weather events in 2024 and studied 29 of them. They found that climate change contributed to at least 3,700 deaths and displaced millions in 26 extreme weather events.

""It is likely the total number of people killed in extreme weather events intensified by climate change this year is in the tens or hundreds of thousands,"" the report said. The floods in Sudan, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, and Chad were the deadliest event studied by the group, with at least 2,000 people killed.

The study found that if global warming reached 2°C, which could happen as early as the 2040s or 2050s, these regions might face similar heavy rainfall events every year.

Friederike Otto, WWA lead and senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College, London, said, ""The impacts of fossil fuel warming have never been clearer or more devastating than in 2024. We are living in a dangerous new era.""

""We know exactly what we need to do to stop things from getting worse — stop burning fossil fuels. The top resolution for 2025 must be transitioning away from fossil fuels, which will make the world a safer and more stable place,"" he added.

Paris Agreement and Emission Reduction
According to Copernicus, the year 2024 is expected to end with a global average temperature of at least 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. However, a permanent breach of the 1.5°C limit specified in the Paris Agreement refers to long-term warming over a 20 or 30-year period. That said, experts feel that the world is now entering a phase where temperatures will be consistently above this threshold.

The average global temperature has already risen by 1.3°C compared to the 1850-1900 average, driven by the rapid buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.N. body for assessing the science related to climate change, says global emissions must peak by 2025 and reduce by 43% by 2030 and 57% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

However, according to the latest U.N. data, current policies will take global warming to around 3°C by 2100.

Even the full implementation of all Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) or National climate plans will likely lead to just a 5.9% emission reduction by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, according to the synthesis report of countries' NDCs.

Fossil fuels — coal, oil, and gas — are the largest contributors to climate change, accounting for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions.

However, the world is struggling to transition away from fossil fuels rapidly enough to prevent breaching the 1.5°C goal due to a combination of political, economic, technological, and social challenges.

The transition to clean energy sources is particularly difficult for poor countries in the Global South due to dependence on fossil fuels for jobs and cheap energy, lack of funding and technology, weak power grids, and limited expertise.","A 2024 report reveals the devastating impact of climate change, with the world experiencing an average of 41 more days of extreme heat. 2024 is projected to be the warmest year on record, exceeding pre-industrial levels by 1.5°C. Small island nations suffered over 130 extra hot days.

Scientists analyzed 219 extreme weather events, linking climate change to at least 3,700 deaths and millions displaced in 26 events. The actual death toll is likely much higher. Floods in Africa were the deadliest, killing at least 2,000. Under a 2°C warming scenario, similar rainfall events could become annual occurrences.

Experts stress the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, the primary driver of climate change. While 2024 breached the 1.5°C threshold, the Paris Agreement considers long-term warming. However, current policies point towards a 3°C warming by 2100, far exceeding the agreement's goals. Despite the urgency, transitioning from fossil fuels faces significant political, economic, and technological hurdles, especially for developing nations."

8032d665cdab9c5b7569569793739e7f,"[DOC 1] Britain has quietly cancelled a competition to develop carbon capture and storage technology, reversing support for a tool intended to help combat global warming ahead of a climate summit in Paris next week.

The change was announced to the london Stock Exchange yesterday as finance minister George Osborne revealed a much-awaited budget update to parliament that vowed to increase investment in energy research.

Proponents of CCS technology -- which aims to capture emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and prevent it entering the atmosphere and causing the planet to warm -- reacted with dismay to the announcement that funding was no longer available for the 1.0 billion pounds (1.4 billion euros, $1.5 billion) scheme.

“Moving the goalposts just at the time when a four-year competition is about to conclude is an appalling way to do business,” said luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association.

He warned that Britain would lose the opportunity to develop cost effective methods of reducing carbon emissions, calling the announcement “devastating”, while industry group EEF said the decision would cost much more than it would save in the long term.

It comes days ahead of a major UN climate summit in Paris which aims to forge an international deal to stop global warming exceeding two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels -- a level scientists hope would avoid the most drastic effects of rising seas and extreme weather.

The Government of Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, who was re-elected for a second term in May on promises of balancing Britain’s budget, has previously been criticised for cutting support for solar and wind energy.

Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said the decision would make Britain’s plan to cut carbon emissions by switching from coal to gas power plans less effective.

“Without CCS available, the Government’s plans to use gas as a ‘bridge’ to a low carbon future will have much more limited mileage in the medium term,” Watson said.

The carbon capture competition had two bidders: the White Rose project to capture 90 per cent of emissions from a coal power plant in Yorkshire in northern England and store it under the North Sea, and a scheme to capture carbon from gas power in Scotland.","Britain has cancelled a competition to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, just ahead of the Paris climate summit.

1f7f75b1f7670f2a579b12217b6e76dc,"[DOC 1] On the surface, there was little about Elena Rybakina’s statistical past that suggested she would have the tournament she had at Wimbledon.

The 23-year-old had won just two of the 61 events she had entered, with a 2-6 win-loss record in finals. She had yet to claim a WTA 1000 title — the quality of the playing field at such events ensures that success there is a reasonable indicator of the potential to do well at a Major.

Before Wimbledon, Rybakina was 17-11 in Grand Slam matches and 11-6 on grass — win-rates ranging from 60-65% aren’t to be disdained, but they do not belong in the elite bracket. Moreover, she had struggled in the build-up to the Major, winning just one of three grass-court matches.

So, it was no surprise that the bookmakers didn’t think highly of her odds of going all the way. They had her as a 100-1 outsider before the tournament got underway. 

When she did triumph, the World No. 23 became the second-lowest-ranked women’s champion at the grass-court event in the professional era, which began in 1968. In this time, just one woman ranked lower than Rybakina has won Wimbledon — Venus Williams in 2007 at No. 31, although she had been No. 1 and already won three of her five career Wimbledon trophies.

“I did not expect to be in the second week of a Grand Slam at Wimbledon,” Rybakina admitted, suggesting that those who had predicted her chances, based on analytical measures of her record until then, had not differed significantly from her own expectations.

But if you had dug a little deeper into her statistical past and subjected her style of play to the ‘eye test’, there were signals that she could be dangerous, especially on faster courts.

Rybakina has a winning record (7-6) against players who have been ranked No. 1. She also has victories over Major winners, including Serena Williams, Garbine Muguruza, Sofia Kenin and Simona Halep — she added Bianca Andreescu to the list and beat Halep again, at Wimbledon. 

Dictating play
Given Rybakina’s playing style, the match is often on her racquet. She has ‘the big game’, with access to rangy, point-ending power through both her serve and flat groundstrokes. One coach described Rybakina as “a right-handed Petra Kvitova” and there are certainly similarities in how both players dictate play — and blow hot and cold.

“It’s effortless the power I have,” Rybakina said. “I never compare myself with anyone. I just know that I have this gift. I’m tall and I play really fast. It’s not something I’m working in the gym or something. This is my weapon, and I’m just trying to use it as much as I can.”

At 1.84 metres (slightly over six feet), Rybakina is among the tallest players in the women’s game and she puts that height to good use: over the last three seasons, she has twice led the tour in aces and was fifth on the other occasion. She pounded a tournament-leading 53 aces at Wimbledon and also unleashed the edition’s second-fastest serve: 122mph (almost 200kmph).

So what changed between being another youngster with the weapons to threaten the best and being able to deploy them strategically over two weeks to become a Grand Slam champion?

“The last three years … I had very good matches, great battles, against great champions, and it was always close. In those close moments I was the one who would lose the serve or just miss. Maybe it mentally clicked [this time]. I believed in myself more in this tournament and in the crucial moments I was just solid enough to win,” Rybakina said.

In addition to overcoming the mental challenges of breaking through on the biggest stage, she also had to deal with being questioned about her Russian roots right through the tournament. With Russian and Belarusian players banned from the grasscourt Major following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Moscow-born Rybakina would have been excluded had she not switched allegiance from Russia in 2018 for better funding and support.

Topic of discussion
Shifting allegiances isn’t normally controversial, but Rybakina’s move to play for Kazakhstan was a frequent topic of discussion at her press conferences. “I would say I’m lucky in this because the Kazakhstan federation, they were looking at the same time for [a] player to help,” Rybakina said, “and they believed in me, so I was just lucky [that] we just found each other like this.”

Rybakina has been guarded in her comments on the invasion. “I just want the war to end as soon as possible. Peace, yeah,” she said after her quarterfinal.

But with the Russian Tennis Federation quick to claim Rybakina as “our product” — its president Shamil Tarpishchev told sports website Championat that “it’s the Russian school after all” — she was pressed on the issue after her triumph.

“I don’t know what’s going to happen. It’s always some news, but I cannot do anything about this,” she said, when asked if the Russian government would be tempted to politicise her victory. “I’m playing for Kazakhstan a very long time. I represent them in the biggest tournaments, Olympics, which was a dream come true.”

Rybakina, whose parents live in Moscow, was reluctant throughout the tournament to elaborate on how much time she spends in Russia, saying instead that she lives on the tour. Invited to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin and the invasion, Rybakina pleaded for understanding. “I didn’t choose where I was born. Kazakhstan supported me so much. Even today I heard so much support. I saw the flags. So I don’t know how to answer these questions.”

Rybakina’s win is the culmination of a long-term plan for tennis in Kazakhstan. The oil-and-gas-rich Central Asian nation has a long tradition of homegrown success in sports such as boxing and cycling but has often relied on recruiting talented tennis players from Russia.

Rybakina made the switch at 19 when her career stalled because of financial issues. The Kazakhstan Tennis Federation stepped in with an offer — represent it in exchange for the cash needed to support the global lifestyle of a tennis player. That decision four years ago has the potential now to transform tennis in the country, given she is Kazakhstan’s first singles Major winner and was a step away from winning Olympic bronze in Tokyo, losing the playoff match.

What’s next for Rybakina?
Can she reprise her Wimbledon form at other Majors or will she add to the growing list of one-time Grand Slam champions on the women’s tour?

Her Croatian coach Stefano Vukov told the BBC that she has the potential to keep on winning. “She is still raw in so many ways so it’s a long process. We started working together at the smallest events and here we are winning Wimbledon. It’s just the beginning,” he said.

“I was 100% sure she could win one,” Vukov added. “She was calm in big moments. I saw that she has this gift. Everybody feels the nerves but she’s a very clutch player and she showed me that from the first tournaments she ever played.”

Rybakina believes she will go to New York next month more confident about the US Open, where she has not made it past the third round in three attempts. “The goal for this year was to be top 10 and it’s still the same goal,” she said. “And to try to win another [Major]. I don’t think yet about the US Open. So many good players and different players just won Grand Slams in the past so I really don’t know how I’m going to feel. But for sure I think I’m coming there more confident.”

Rybakina’s success will, however, have some less pleasant effects: she now has a target on her back and will attract more attention as a tennis celebrity, something she doesn’t care for.

“Everybody is trying to help me because it’s the first time and there is so much attention,” she said. “It’s not easy for me, because I’m a calm person. I don’t really like to be in front of everybody. This part of the job is still tough for me, but hopefully everybody will help me improve in this, like I did in tennis. Let’s see. Hopefully it will get better and better.”","Elena Rybakina’s Wimbledon victory was an unexpected triumph, given her relatively modest track record before the tournament. With a career characterized by underperformance in finals and lack of significant titles, her triumph as a 100-1 outsider marked a major breakthrough. Despite her lower ranking and struggles on grass, Rybakina’s powerful game, including a strong serve and aggressive groundstrokes, was a dangerous weapon. Her mental fortitude, honed through past close losses, played a crucial role in her success.

Her decision to switch allegiances from Russia to Kazakhstan in 2018 was a pivotal moment in her career, as it provided the financial support she needed. Though frequently questioned about her Russian roots, Rybakina’s focus remained on her tennis, with her coach expressing confidence that this was just the beginning. Her Wimbledon win puts her on the map as a formidable contender for future majors, though the added attention and pressure may challenge her calm nature.

As Rybakina looks forward to the US Open and other events, her goal remains to be in the top 10 and to win more Grand Slams, despite the added pressure of her newfound celebrity status."

Chidambaram's strategy underscores the government's commitment to bolstering revenue streams and narrowing the fiscal deficit. By casting a wide net and targeting big fish, the Finance Minister aims to plug leakages in the tax system and create a more equitable tax regime.

The announcement has sparked widespread discussions among economists, policymakers, and the public. While some applaud the government's proactive stance against tax evasion and fiscal indiscipline, others express concerns about the potential impact on investment sentiment and economic growth.

Critics argue that targeting big fish could deter investment and dampen business sentiment, particularly among high-net-worth individuals and multinational corporations. Additionally, there are concerns about the feasibility of effectively implementing such measures without unduly burdening compliant taxpayers.

However, proponents contend that the move is necessary to ensure that all segments of society contribute their fair share to nation-building efforts. They emphasize the importance of curbing tax evasion to maintain fiscal discipline and fund critical development initiatives.

Chidambaram's budget announcement marks a significant shift in India's fiscal policy landscape, signaling a more aggressive approach towards tax compliance and revenue generation. As the government moves forward with its agenda to net big fish, the nation watches closely to see how these measures will shape the economic landscape in the years to come.","On January 3, 2013, during the budget announcement, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram revealed plans to target significant players in a move aimed at enhancing fiscal stability. This strategy likely encompassed measures such as tax reforms, increased scrutiny on high-income individuals and corporations, and efforts to curb tax evasion. The term ""net big fish"" suggests a focus on apprehending major tax evaders or implementing policies that would affect wealthy individuals and large corporations. The announcement likely sparked discussions about the potential impact on the economy, investment climate, and income distribution. Chidambaram's approach underscored the government's commitment to fiscal discipline and equitable taxation policies."

 Sources said the Commission on Agricultural Cost and Prices (CACP) has suggested a bonus of Rs 20 per quintal over the MSP for paddy in view of the drought conditions. It has also suggested reduction in the hike in fertiliser prices.
 
 The government had yesterday announced the minimum support price (MSP) for paddy, but had retained the prices at last year’s level.
 
 Agriculture Ministry officials said the CACP on whose recommendations the MSP was fixed, was asked by Agriculture Minister Ajit Singh to look at the issue afresh in view of the problems faced by farmers due to drought this year. They said the first CACP report had not taken into account the drought conditions.
 
 The fresh recommendations of the CACP were submitted to the government this week and a decision on these would be taken at the next meeting of the Cabinet, sources said.
 
 Agriculture Minister officials said with the MSP having been announced, the Punjab Government could start procurement of paddy immediately. On the issue of proposed reduction of levies to 4 per cent from 11.5 per cent, which is a major concern for the Punjab Government, the officials said it was only a proposal which had not been approved by the government.
 
 They said levies were unlikely to be reduced this year and the issue would also figure at the meeting of Chief Ministers on October 18.
 
 The Agriculture Ministry, it is learnt, has submitted a note suggesting that levies should not be reduced this year.",Commission on Agricultural Cost and Prices (CACP) has suggested a bonus of Rs 20 per quintal over the MSP for paddy in view of the drought conditions.

“Consumers purchase mediclaim policies to cover medical emergencies and exigencies and the insurance company should not reject claims on whimsical and technical grounds,” the North Delhi District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum said.


The forum, headed by its president K.S. Mohi, directed the Oriental Insurance Co Ltd to pay Rs 90,879 along with a sum of Rs 10,000, to Saket resident Keshav Saran Sharma, holding that the company had rejected his claims on frivolous grounds.

It rejected the company’s claim that the patient’s insurance cover had expired and held that there was no delay in renewal of the policy.


“In this case, there is not even a single hour break in the 2nd policy.

Therefore, taking into view the totality of facts and circumstances of the case and especially the fact that the patient was discharged on January 30, 2012 i.e. well within the currency of the insurance policy, the repudiation by the insurance company was illegal and unjustified,” it said.


In his complaint, Mr Sharma had said he taken a mediclaim policy valid from January 27, 2011, till midnight of January 26, 2012, and the sum insured was Rs 2,50,000.

He said that his wife was admitted for treatment of breast cancer on January 26, 2012 at Max Super Specialty Hospital in Saket and discharged within four days.

Sharma had also claimed that the premium for renewal of policy was paid on January 23, 2012 but the insurance company renewed the policy by maintaining the continuity from 00.00 hours January 27, 2012 till midnight of January 26, 2013.


The insurance company rejected the claim of Sharma saying that the patient was admitted on January 26, 2012, which was the date of expiry of the policy.


The forum observed that the company had collected the premium cheque dated January 23, 2012, much before the date of policy renewal.

“This policy also shows that the premium cheque dated January 23, 2012 for a sum of `23,514 was collected by the company on January 23, 2012 i.e. much before the date of renewal of the policy,” it held.","A consumer forum in India has directed Oriental Insurance Co Ltd to pay Rs 90,879 and Rs 10,000 to Saket resident Keshav Saran Sharma.

c220ea42f9711077f212ce91a98cc37e,"[DOC 1] As talks of an anti-BJP front for the next lok Sabha polls gain ground, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said he is not in favour of joining hands with the Congress to forge an opposition alliance that should be aimed at giving people a real political alternative .

Vijayan, 73, also said that regional parties are strong these days and that the synergy between them could be used to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) in the general elections due next year. Alleging that the BJP has been destroying the country’s democratic norms, the CPI-M veteran, who completes two years in office next May, said co-operation between regional parties was essential to “defeat those who must be defeated”.

The remarks by the lone communist chief minister come against the backdrop of West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee and her Telangana counterpart and Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief K Chandrashekhar Rao kickstarting efforts to form a so-called Federal Front’ with or without the Congress.

Regional parties are strong these days. Regional tie-ups can be considered during elections for a real political alternative. There is no point in joining hands with one particular party at the national level, Vijayan told PTI in an exclusive interview here.

The draft political resolution adopted at CPI-M’s Central Committee meeting in Kolkata in January this year had ruled out any electoral alliance or understanding with the Congress.

But, the Committee had said that the main objective of the party is to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party and it will focus on “mobilising all secular democratic forces for that purpose.

Interestingly, on March 30, the CPM announced that it would support the “strongest candidates” who would be in a position to defeat the BJP in the upcoming Assembly polls in Karnataka, which might mean even supporting Congress nominees.

Continuing his scathing attack on the BJP-led NDA government, Vijayan said secular minds are disturbed by the happenings around the country which would lead to a movement sweeping away the right-wing Government from power. Vijayan was in Delhi to attend the Central Committee meeting of the CPI-M early this week. There is a new uprising. Take a look at the farmers’ uprising in some states. The states ruled by the BJP are witnessing people’s movements, he said.

“Trade unions are agitating. The cultural scene in the country is already in trouble. The youth and the campuses across the country are on streets protesting for their democratic rights. There is a need for a real (political) alternative.

The chief minister also said it was saddening that certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a puppet in the hands of the government, remarks seen as an attack against the Election Commission of India.

The poll body faced criticism over its controversial decision to delay the declaration of the Gujarat Asembly polls last year until the last rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“They (BJP) are destroying the Constitutional bodies of the country. Certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a puppet in the hands of government. This is saddening. Secular minds are disturbed by the happenings. Secularism is in great danger here. A movement will begin in the country which will sweep the BJP away from power,” he said.

“What we have to focus on now is how is to effect a change. When we are able to show some difference, it brings an overall change. It may not give us any political advantage but we could bring some change by helping to defeat those who must be defeated,” Vijayan added.

Vijayan, while talking about the recent assembly polls in Tripura where the longstanding bastion of the left Front collapsed in the saffron wave, said it was the Congress party which lost its base there.

In the state Assembly elections since 1983, the BJP had never polled more than 2 percent votes in Tripura, except in 1998 when it polled 5.87 percent votes.

“The Centre’s show of authority and a huge money flow resulted in BJP coming to power in Tripura, he alleged, adding, The 10 MlAs that the Congress had there now belong to the BJP .

He also pointed out that 36 of the BJP candidates fielded in the Tripura election were with the Congress party last time and the grand old party could garner only 1.5 per cent of the vote, when compared to the 36 per cent it got last time.

“The rest went to BJP. It means that the Congress has became BJP. Along with that they joined hands with the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT),” he said.

“If we look at Uttar Pradesh assembly election last year, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress contested together. SP had considerable influence there but that was not visible in the election. At the same time Congress lost its deposit at many places,” he said.

Referring to the denial of permission for notices for no-confidence motion against the government in lok Sabha, Vijayan said democratic norms are getting toppled .

lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has cited lack of order in the House for not taking up the notices.

“The Parliament functions as per a procedure. If a no-confidence motion was moved, and has got enough support, then how can one try to stop itIJ They were saying that the Speaker was not able to ascertain the number of members inside the house. It’s ridiculous. This is a black mail.","Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan says regional party alliances, not Congress, are key to defeating BJP in 2024 Lok Sabha polls. He criticizes BJP for undermining democracy and Constitutional bodies, sees a rising movement against it. He blames Congress for losing its base in Tripura, leading to BJP victory. Vijayan advocates regional tie-ups for a real political alternative, not national alliances with Congress."

NEW DELHI: The murder of IITian Satyendra Kumar Dubey, who was working on Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s â€˜â€˜Golden Quadrilateralâ€™â€™ project, is not the only incident to have marred the project.
The biggest and the costliest ever project undertaken by the National Highway Authority of India and carried out by contractors is meant to streamline road ways across the country.
But, certain means chosen are suspect in the eyes of the law. The apex court has already castigated various authorities for failing to implement its orders.

The frequent breach of law has given rise to powerful vested interests and even court orders are not implemented, the SC noted.
Raising embankments and other construction works undertaken by the project violated the guidelines and directions notified by the Union government following the Delhi High Courtâ€™s judgment in a public interest litigation in 1999.
A drive of 400 km on the national highway is good enough to see that the Centreâ€™s notification had been defied.
The directive that 25 per cent of fly ash, produced by several coal and lignite based thermal plants, must be used in raising embankments and other construction activities has been flouted with impunity.

The top soil has been excavated from the riverâ€™s bed in complete disregard to the specification that â€˜â€˜clay/earth/soil shall not be lifted in continuous stretch. The borrow pits should be suitably staggeredâ€™â€™.

This violation has posed an imminent threat of floods, soil erosion and loss of forests area.

In fact, the notification bans excavation of land or sand from any river bed within 50 km of coal or lignite based thermal plants. This could be relaxed only if at least 25 per cent of freely available fly ash is used along with the unearthed material.

In another social interest litigation relating to public health, the apex court had asked the government to utilise massive amount of fly ash which otherwise is a serious health hazard causing respiratory and lung disease.


The notification thus seeks to kill two birds with one stoneâ€” utilisation of fly ash which is supplied by the power plants free of cost and minimising the danger of diseases.

The haphazard digging operations have added to the farmersâ€™ woes.



The Centre recently ordered an inquiry into complaints by a large number of farmers from Delhi and other states alleging that their land falling in the river bed had been unauthorisedly excavated by contractors for putting up embankments.
","Murder of IITian Satyendra Kumar Dubey linked to the 'Golden Quadrilateral' project.
- National Highway Authority of India overseeing the project.
- Project aims to streamline roadways across the country.
- Supreme Court criticizes authorities for not implementing its orders.
- Construction activities violate government guidelines and court orders.
- 25% of fly ash from thermal plants supposed to be used, but not enforced.
- Top soil excavated from river beds against specifications.
- Violations pose threats of floods, soil erosion, and loss of forest area.
- Notification prohibits excavation near thermal plants without using fly ash.
- Fly ash utilization mandated for public health and cost-effectiveness.
- Farmers complain of unauthorized excavation on their lands for embankments.

The video continued for several minutes and was stopped only after some commuters brought it to the attention of DMRC officials at the station.The incident was recorded by several commuters on their mobile phones and has been shared multiple times on various social media platforms, forcing the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to initiate an inquiry. DMRC said three unidentified men may have played the clip on the big screen as the system is not secure.Anuj Dayal, the DMRC spokesperson, said after preliminary investigations, it has been established that the incident took place around 5pm on April 9. ?The LED TV system was being commissioned and its Wi-Fi port was accessible.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.

Additionally, efforts to enhance rice milling capacity and promote millets and coarse grains procurement were discussed. State governments were urged to implement smart PDS and upgrade storage facilities."
da18284c1d5bafea84d03a821dd1809c,"[DOC 1] NEW DELHI: In one night alone, cameras placed on a
400m stretch on Tilak Marg detected about 4,000
violations. The trial last month, to check how the cameras
worked, shows how advanced equipment can detect
violations that deployment of traffic cops just cannot
achieve.
Delhi Traffic Police, which was allocated funds for
modernization in this year's Budget, plan to smooth out
several problems in traffic management with the help of
technology.The department doesn't have equipment to
check tinted glass or count vehicles on the road. ""We need
to work out several modalities as few Indian firms certification, also need to be looked into. It's not just a
question of buying them off the shelf,"" said additional
commissioner of police (traffic)
.
Cops are on the lookout for luxmeters, which check the
percentage of visual light transmission (VLT) on tinted
glass of vehicles; red speed cameras with night vision,
which record violations involving jumping traffic signals
and speeding; and cameras that can detect lane
violations, zigzag driving and sudden changes in speed.
""The problem with procuring luxmeters is that there are
few original manufacturers in the country. Readings from
these devices can serve as evidence in court only if they
are properly certified. We are contacting original
equipment manufacturers,"" said a senior traffic police
officer.
Police want to install lane-violation detector cameras at
regular distances along stretches for spotting vehicles
travelling in the wrong lane or being driven in a zigzag
manner. ""Many drivers speed for a long while and then
abruptly slow down near cameras. With these cameras,
however, average speeds can be calculated along with
detecting lane violations, and challans can be issued
accordingly. But, we need to tie up with the transport
department to check vehicles registered outside Delhi or
unregistered vehicles,"" added the officer.
Cops are also eyeing gadgets like portable LED screens
offering real-time traffic information and warning vehicles
about restrictions on entry. ""These can warn drivers of a
vehicle breakdown or traffic diversion ahead, and help
prevent traffic chaos,"" said the officer.
Several other gadgets being used worldwide could also be
of interest to Delhi cops. These include a licence-plate
reader, which can detect stolen vehicles. These cameras

messages, reduces speed limits on stretches as well as
provides diversions accordingly. This system is used in
places like Australia, Scotland, Georgia (USA),
 and London.","The Delhi Traffic Police are embracing advanced technology to enhance traffic management. Trials on Tilak Marg showed cameras detecting thousands of violations, highlighting the efficacy of such systems. Plans include deploying luxmeters for tinted glass, red speed cameras for signal jumping, and lane-violation detectors. Collaboration with the transport department is sought for vehicles outside Delhi. Other proposed gadgets include LED screens for real-time traffic updates, license plate readers for stolen vehicles, and alcohol interlocks for commercial vehicles. An adaptive traffic management system, used globally, aims to optimize traffic flow based on city characteristics."

The pamphlets that the duo -- Manorajan D and Sagar Sharma -- carried into the Lok Sabha had the picture of a fist against the backdrop of a tricolour, a slogan in Hindi and a slogan in English on the Manipur violence issue.

In a major security breach on the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack, Sagar and Manoranjan jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during Zero Hour on Wednesday, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by the MPs.

Around the same time, two others -- Amol Shinde and Neelam Devi -- sprayed coloured gas from canisters while shouting ""tanashahi nahi chalegi"" outside Parliament premises.

Police have filed terrorism charges under the stringent UAPA against the four people.

According to the FIR, the smoke canisters, which were opened inside and outside Parliament, had warnings and instructions to ""wear goggles and gloves"" while opening.

A cavity was cut into the left sole of the LCR-made grey coloured sports shoes of Sagar Sharma. The thickness of the soles was increased by affixing additional rubber to support the cavity, it stated, adding that Manoranjan D's sports shoes too had a similar cavity in the left sole.

Police said the right sole of the shoe was also found partly cut.

The police registered the FIR at the Parliament Street police station based on a complaint filed by a police staffer.

""I along with inspector Vinay Kumar, officiating SHO PS Parliament Street, and other staff reached the office of the director of security of the new Parliament House Building where Omkar Singh, Deputy Director(S) Lok Sabha was present.

1f2da2a41135841ec62355ae125565bd,"[DOC 1] If the Lok Sabha elections were the first sign that Indian voters were in favour of a development agenda as opposed to narrow caste-based considerations, last week?s assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana reinforce that message; more so given that national and local elections don?t always go the same way. In Haryana, where the BJP has never come to power alone, it swept the 90-member assembly with 47 seats?its previous best was 5. In Maharashtra, the BJP nearly trebled its 2009 performance and got just 22 short of an absolute majority in the state. While the voters in Haryana ditched their caste confines in favour of a government with a clean image and a development track record, in Maharashtra, voters snubbed the Shiv Sena?s Maharashtra-for-Maharashtrians agenda. Indeed, Raj Thackeray?s breakaway MNS, which was even more Marathi manoos, than Uddhav?s Shiv Sena, won just one seat. Ironic that, had the Shiv Sena not got into a seat-sharing fight with the BJP?which BJP President Amit Shah reinforced when he said it was the Shiv Sena that broke the alliance, not the BJP?this is something that would have remained untested. While the government has already used the political space provided?a day before the results were declared?to push through some welcome reform on freeing up diesel prices and proceeding towards using direct benefit transfers on LPG (the gas price hike was a bit of a washout since vital details have not yet been announced), the win means a lot more can be expected; which is why markets rose 321 points the day after the election results were announced. Some of India?s top-performing states?Maharashtra and Gujarat?are now BJP-ruled and that will go a long way in pushing through economic reforms; more so since the real action is in the states. Rajasthan has already shown the way in terms of labour reforms, but the state is low on the priority list for investors?imagine the impact if both Gujarat and Maharashtra were to announce something similar. Though each state has its own concerns on GST, and just because it is a BJP state doesn?t mean it will automatically fall in line, this will surely facilitate the process of introducing GST as there will no longer be any opposition for the sake of opposition. Given how President?s rule allowed the BJP to push on mandi reform in Delhi, it can be expected that Vashi?s monopoly in Mumbai will also soon be dismantled. The other issue, as Credit Suisse economist Neelkanth Mishra points out, since sales tax and labour inspectors and the police are all state government employees, winning more states puts the BJP in a better position to tackle this. The DMICDC states, where the big burst of city development is expected to take place, similarly, are all controlled by the BJP. All in all, the development augurs well for India?s reforms process.","BJP swept the 90-member assembly with 47 seats?its previous best was 5.

There is, however, no formal orders for all the committees to use this means.

The Budget session of Parliament had ended abruptly on March 23 and since then no meeting of these parliamentary committees had been held . Mr. Tharoor announced on Twitter that his committee would meet soon.

“Delighted to announce that Lok Sabha Speaker @ombirlakota has approved the holding of meetings of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology by video conference. What could be more appropriate than for our Committee to set this welcome precedent?” the Congress leader said.

He had written a letter to Mr. Birla on April 17 requesting him to reconsider the curtailing of activities of parliamentary committees since the ministries continue to function with officials working remotely. “It is imperative that our committees also continue to meet periodically so that they can execute their constitutional mandates of scrutinising the activities of the Executive,” he wrote.

Mr. Tharoor said a number of pressing issues had developed even in this short duration for each of these committees to consider urgently and, therefore, it was imperative that they were allowed to convene and discuss such time-sensitive concerns.

Rule 267 concerning the functioning of committees says that ‘The sittings of a committee shall be held within the precincts of the Parliament House, and if it becomes necessary to change the place of sitting outside the Parliament House, the matter shall be referred to the Speaker whose decision shall be final’.

Bar on videoconferencing

As a norm, use of videoconferencing to hold meetings or deposition of witnesses during the meeting was barred. “The basic thing is about the confidentiality of the meeting and deposition of the government. Once the meeting is held through a videoconference, how will you ensure that the member on the other end of the videoconference is alone,” Labour Committee Chairman B. Mahtab explained the need for such a rule. He said that if permission was granted, he would soon convene a meeting on the condition of migrant labourers and the lack of safeguards for them highlighted during the lockdown.

‘Agriculture crippled’

Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture Parvatagouda C Gaddigoudar too said he would soon call a meeting. “We are going through a grave crisis and the lockdown has severely crippled agriculture. We need to assess the impact on harvesting and sale of produce. So I have spoken to the Lok Sabha Secretariat staff and we are looking for options on how to go about it. We will try to hold a meeting by May first week at the earliest,” he said.

Last week, Congress MP Manish Tewari wrote to Jayant Sinha, Chairman of the Finance Committee, urging him to call a meeting at the earliest. Mr. Sinha hasn’t so far responded to his request.

Mr. Tewari said there was need for a joint committee on COVID-19. “The time has come for Parliament to constitute a joint select committee that will help evaluate our response in a holistic manner and not just sectorally,” Mr. Tewari told The Hindu .

12ee1a539cfdedbd0af16fc9839691b5,"[DOC 1] In December last year, in the run-up to the UP elections, Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya had shared a tweet suggesting that a temple would come up in Mathura on the lines of Ayodhya and Varanasi. Weeks later, CM Yogi Adityanath spoke on the same lines, effectively setting the tone for the BJP’s campaign in Mathura. Yet, in Mant, one of the five Assembly constituencies that make up Mathura district, the Sangh’s temple agenda is not central to any conversation on the election. Instead, it’s the candidate who gets a lot of attention — Shyam Sundar Sharma, 72, an eight-time winner from Mant, who is considered to be above caste equations. Locals say Sharma, the BSP’s candidate, wins purely on popular sentiment. “There is a reason why Shyam Sundar has won so many times. First, he never refuses anyone’s calls. He spends all his time on the ground. From providing handpumps to fixing roads, he has touched several lives. At this point, Shyam Sundar can stand as an Independent ticket and still win,” says Ompal Singh, 50, as he sits huddled with his other Jat friends on a wooden bench in Mant’s Jasoli Kala. Shyam Sundar won his first MLA election in 1989 from Mant and has represented the seat ever since. While he fought his first few elections as a Congress candidate, in 2016, he joined the BSP. The only election he lost was in 2012, when RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary defeated Shyam Sundar by nearly 16,000 votes. But as Chaudhary decided to resign as MLA and keep his MP seat (Mathura), Shyam Sundar won from the same seat in a bypoll which he fought on a TMC ticket for the sake of a symbol. “The BJP is trying to rake up many issues but it won’t work here. People here need someone who can listen to them,” Sharma told The Indian Express. This time, he is up against Rajesh Chaudhary of the BJP and Sanjay Lathar of SP-RLD combine. A seat with a predominant Jat presence, Mant also has a sizeable Bhramin, Thakur and Dalit population. Both BJP and SP have given tickets to Jat candidates, given the majority population, but Sanjay Lathar, the SP candidate, is on a sticky wicket since he got the ticket in place of Yogesh Chaudhary, an RLD leader who a local favourite. Residents recall the 2012 bypolls when the SP, in a massive show of strength, sent several ministers to campaign for Lathar. Yet, Lathar lost to Shyam Sundar. As one travels from Mant to Mathura, a city that revolves around its temples, the crowds get denser. The city is part of Mathura Assembly seat that is represented by Cabinet Minister Shrikant Sharma. In the previous election, Sharma won by a margin of nearly 1 lakh votes against Pradeep Mathur of the Congress. While residents express their anger at “the lack of development in the last five years” and blame the party and the candidate, Yogi remains a big draw. “Shrikant majboori hai kyunki Yogi zaruri hai (We have no option but to back Shrikant because it’s important that Yogi stays). There is no denying that the MLA could have done more. But we believe in Yogi Adityanath because he has given us a sense of security,” says Rakesh Agarwal, a trader in Mathura’s Holi Gate market. Shrikant Sharma is up against BSP’s S K Sharma, who recently left the BJP after he was denied a ticket from Mant. The BSP candidate is banking on his Brahmin community’s nearly four lakh votes, besides the support of Jatavs, to dent the BJP’s chances. Away from the city, the highway towards Delhi is lined on either side with factories, warehouses and godowns. Adjacent to the railway line, a group of people begin their walk home as the sun is about to set. Most of them are daily-wage labourers who turn up every morning to seek work in the factories nearby. Some days they are lucky. “As Covid hit, we suffered a lot because our work became irregular. The situation has not improved. Most days we come here and sit in the park, waiting for work and go back empty-handed. I have a 3-year-old son and every day seems more difficult than the last,” says an agitated Ashok, 32, resident of Azizpur village, which comes under Chaata constituency in Mathura. Animal Husbandry and Dairy Minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, the sitting MLA, has won four times from Chaata while RLD candidate Tejpal Singh has been the winner thrice. Laxmi Narayan was previously in the BSP and served as Cabinet minister during Mayawati’s regime. Here, too, the MLA and the BJP are held responsible for problems of unemployment and stray cattle, yet Adityanath gets praised for “keeping goons in check”.
","In Mathura district's Mant constituency, the BJP’s temple agenda takes a backseat to BSP candidate Shyam Sundar Sharma, an eight-time winner known for his grassroots work and ability to rise above caste politics. Sharma, who started with Congress and later joined BSP, remains popular despite challenges from BJP and SP Jat candidates. In Mathura city, BJP’s Shrikant Sharma holds the seat amid criticism over development, but Yogi Adityanath’s image as a strong leader remains a major factor. Meanwhile, in Chaata constituency, daily wage laborers struggle with unemployment and stray cattle issues, holding the sitting BJP MLA responsible, yet still praising Yogi for maintaining law and order.

I am rather eager to see the results. “ And when asked as whether he was too sure of his victory, he in a diplomatic way answered,” I got the maximum response in this election from all across the parliamentary constituency and hence I am sure a good news will prevail upon by tomorrow afternoon.” He added,” Akalis tried to buy votes, they offered Rs 500 for a vote, they tried to intimidate our polling agents and what not on poll day, but it did not work and the results will show the truth.”

Though Harsimrat was in meditation session the whole day on Thursday, but her kids were back home in Badal village. On Friday, her younger daughter Gurleen Kaur’s birthday while elder daughter Harkirat will be turning 19 on May 17.

baf1c952cd69c92b96d890cb39eff270,"[DOC 1] Digital mammography delivers significantly less radiation than conventional
mammography, and the reduction in radiation exposure may be greater for women with
larger and denser breasts, a new study has found.
In the study, researchers analyzed data from 5,102 women who received both digital and
standard film mammography.
The average breast radiation dose per view was 22 per cent lower for digital than film
mammography.
The ability to reduce the radiation dose for many women is another step forward for
breast cancer screening with mammography, which saves thousands of lives each year,”
study’s lead author R. Edward Hendrick said.
In digital mammography, X-ray images are collected on a digital detector and stored on a
computer, rather than being collected and stored on film. A previous study published in
2005 found that digital mammography detected up to 28 percent more cancers than film
mammography in women under age 50, in those who were pre- or peri-menopausal, and in
women with dense breasts.
“While the radiation dose from both film and digital mammography are low, further dose
reduction is an added benefit of digital mammography over and above its ability to better
detect cancers in women with dense breasts,” Hendrick added.
Currently, more than 60 per cent of U.S. breast imaging facilities offer digital
mammography.
“As digital mammography has now been shown to significantly lower the radiation dose, it
is likely that access to it will continue to grow,” Hendrick said in the news release.
The findings were published in the February issue of the American Journal of
Roentgenology.","A new study suggests that digital mammography exposes women to significantly less radiation compared to conventional film mammography, particularly benefiting those with larger and denser breasts. Analyzing data from over 5,000 women, researchers found a 22% reduction in breast radiation dose with digital mammography. This advancement further enhances breast cancer screening efficacy, particularly for women with dense breasts, potentially leading to increased access to digital mammography."

affairs minister S Jaishankar has said, citing violence in front of the Indian
missions and intimidation of Indian diplomats there.
Addressing a press meet in Washington, the minister also said India does not
require lessons from others on the concept of freedom of speech.
""Our point is that today there is a climate of violence, an atmosphere of
intimidation... Just think about it, we have had smoke bombs thrown at the
mission, we have had our consulates...violence in front of them, individuals have
been targeted and intimidated, there are posters put up about people...,"" he said. All this forced the country to temporarily
suspend visa operations in Canada. ""It's not something we would have liked to do. It is just that they made it very
difficult for us to operate those services,"" the minister said. ""Let's not normalise what is happening in Canada,"" he said. ""What is happening in Canada, had it happened anywhere
else, do you think the world would've taken it with equanimity?""
Freedom of expression should not extend to incitement of violence, he said.
""I flagged here (in the US), and I flagged this to the Canadians as well,"" the minister said. ""We are a democracy. We don't
need to learn from other people what freedom of speech is about. But we can tell people this - we don't think freedom of
speech extends to incitement to violence. That, to us, is the misuse of freedom...that's not defence of freedom.""
Jaishankar asked if any other country's diplomats faced the same situation, how would have they reacted to it? ""I think
it's a reasonable question to ask... How would you react if you were in my shoes? If it was your diplomats, your embassy,
your people, what would be your reaction?""
It is important that the US has India's point of view on the matter as well, because Washington has good relations with
both Ottawa and New Delhi, the minister said.
""No incident is isolated, and no incident is the totality. There is a context for everything and there are multiple problems
out there,"" he said.","External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, addressing a press meet in Washington, highlighted the violence and intimidation faced by Indian diplomats and missions in Canada.

The suspension of seven Rajya Sabha MPs to facilitate the passage of Women’s Reservation Bill yesterday has now become a major bone of contention between the government and the Yadav triumvirate, who are opposing the Bill. While RJD and SP MPs staged a walkout and boycotted the Rajya Sabha proceedings for the rest of the day, their leaders in Lok Sabha, Mulayam Singh Yadav (SP), Lalu Prasad (RJD) and Sharad Yadav (JD-U) stalled the House, raising slogans against the government and forcing repeated adjournments.

The trio was seen speaking to Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj alleging that the government was now planning to rope in the CRPF to physically remove them from Lok Sabha.

The government, though realizing that the act has hurt the members, appeared adamant on seeking apology from the seven Rajya Sabha MPs --- Subhash Yadav (RJD), Kamal Akhtar, Aamir Ali Khan and Nand Kishore Yadav (SP) Sabir Ali (LJP) and Ejaz Ali (JD-U) for obstructing Chairman Hamid Ansari from running the House proceedings.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal insisted on apology a precondition for moving the resolution for suspension revocation. But the suspended members have ruled this out. Kamal Akhtar told the media outside Parliament House, “We will never apologize. We are willing to forego our membership rather than tender an apology.”

On the other hand, the BJP and the Left, are keen to bury the hatchet When SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav raised the issue in Rajya Sabha as soon as the Question Hour began, he was supported by RJD leader Prem Chand Gupta and CPM’s Sitaram Yechury. But the treasury benches insisted on apology first.

Outside the House too, CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said: “The Women’s Reservation Bill is a very important piece of legislation. It should be passed in a more persuasive manner and not exactly the way it was done”.

Dasgupta joined Yechury to demand revocation of suspension. “These members were suspended after a resolution was moved by the government. Now, the government should move a resolution withdrawing the suspension which can be adopted by the House,” Yechury said.

Leader of Opposition Arun Jaitely went a step further. He pointed out that the government was in a minority in Rajya Sabha. The Left and the BJP could move the resolution, putting the government in a spot, he added.","The suspension of seven Rajya Sabha MPs to facilitate the passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill has sparked a major controversy, particularly with opposition parties like the RJD, SP, and JD-U.

Despite this, the suspended members, including Subhash Yadav (RJD) and Kamal Akhtar (SP), have refused to apologize, with Akhtar stating that they would rather forgo their membership than apologize. The BJP and Left parties have called for the revocation of the suspension, with CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta and CPM’s Sitaram Yechury emphasizing the need for a more persuasive approach to passing the bill."

This has not been a good monsoon for cities in India. Bad urban planning, more rainfall than expected, and a severe lack of preparedness combined to throw lives out of gear in many cities across India. Here are 5 articles from the HT archives that explain the worst of flooding this monsoon.
Natural mishaps have an uncanny way to expose all that is wrong with India’s urban planning and infrastructure. The unusually heavy rains on August 21 – the heaviest in 16 years – starkly did that reality check at an unlikeliest of places: Chandigarh, the country’s first and, arguably the most, well-planned city since Independence. A 115-mm downpour in just three hours morphed the much-acclaimed ‘City Beautiful’ into an ugly chaos that its denizens had scarcely ever imagined.","Floods are natural disasters where water covers land that is usually dry. They happen when heavy rain, storms, or melting snow make rivers overflow or when dams break. Floods can be dangerous, causing damage to homes, crops, and infrastructure. People and animals may need to evacuate to stay safe.

Floods have both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, they can lead to immediate danger, displacement, and loss of belongings. In the long term, communities may struggle to recover, facing challenges like rebuilding homes and restoring normal life.

Preventing and preparing for floods is crucial. Early warning systems, strong infrastructure, and community education can help minimize the impact of floods. It's essential for individuals and governments to work together to reduce the risks and better respond to these natural disasters."

Borgohain, MLA from Thowra seat in upper Assam, has also quit the state Assembly and the speaker has accepted his resignation.

“Countrymen should look at these piles of currency notes and then hear the addresses of its (Congress) leaders on honesty,” he said in a post with several emojis. The news report also showed a picture of several almirahs stuffed with currency notes. With the Lok Sabha elections approaching, Prime Minister Modi has turned up the heat on Opposition parties in his posts on X.

He, in a recent post, had cited a news clip to take a swipe at Opposition leaders and their “ecosystem”, saying they might remain happy with their arrogance, lies, pessimism and ignorance, but people should be beware of their divisive agenda as a 70-yr-old habit which cannot go away so easily.

After the PM raised the issue, the BJP trained its guns on the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Opposition alliance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized the opposition on corruption, asserting that every penny looted from the people would be recovered. The statement came in response to the Income Tax department reportedly recovering Rs 220 crores in cash from locations linked to Congress MP Dhiraj Prasad Sahu.

With the Lok Sabha elections approaching, the Prime Minister has intensified his criticism of opposition parties.

The report is sought before furlough extension is granted. The prison authorities are likely to take a decision on Saturday.
However, Dutt does not have to worry about prosecution even if his furlough extension plea is rejected. A new circular issued by the prison department states that for those on furlough, failure to report back to jail on the 29th day after the ""initial 14 days and a 14-day extension taken as granted"" would attract a charge under Section 224 of the IPC.
The circular, a copy of which TOI has, was issued by additional DGP Meera Borwankar and sets the cut off date for dealing with convicts who jump furlough and parole. When out of jail on parole, the offence under Section 224 will be registered if they fail to show up at the prison doors at the end of 90 days-including the initial 30-day parole along with two extensions of 30 days each. The circular states that a notice will have to be issued against the person standing surety for a prisoner who has absconded and proceedings can be initiated against him.
Dutt's lawyer Hitesh Jain said if after 14 days no decision taken, it could mean a ""deemed approval"".

Minister of state for home Ram Shinde told a TV channel that between December 24 and 27, 2014, 34 convicts were granted furlough, including 1993 blasts convict Zaibunissa Kazi.

The prisons department, Pune had sent a reminder to the assistant commissioner of police, Bandra division on Friday to respond to the January 1 notice.


Dutt's 14 days' leave had expired on Thursday. He had arrived at the Yerawada Central Prison with two lawyers in two separate cars on Thursday afternoon, but he went back after an hour when the prison authorities told him that he may not have to surrender before Friday, pending a decision on his request of extension of leave. Dutt did not return to prison on Friday.

Rajendra Dhamane, deputy inspector general of prisons, told TOI that he had sent an email to the assistant commissioner of police to enable him to pass necessary orders.


When asked why Dutt had not returned to the prison, Dhamane (without naming the actor) replied that a convict who has been released on furlough for 14 days can stay outside for another two weeks, for a total of maximum 28 days and his plea for seeking extension of furlough can be decided anytime during this period on receiving a report from police.","The Mumbai police have submitted their report on actor Sanjay Dutt's furlough to the Yerwada prison authorities in Pune, which is a standard procedure before considering an extension. The decision regarding the extension is expected to be made on Saturday.

Interestingly, even if Dutt's furlough extension plea is rejected, he won't face prosecution immediately. A new circular from the prison department stipulates that failure to return to jail after the initial 14 days and a 14-day extension granted during furlough would attract charges under Section 224 of the IPC. However, if no decision is taken within 14 days, it could be considered a ""deemed approval.""

417c437af562d4e6bd77f1af85825ded,"[DOC 1] After turning net sellers of Indian paper in May, for the first time since April last year, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) emerged net buyer of corporate and government bonds in June.

While FIIs were net buyers of Indian debt in June at $277.70 million, they were net sellers at $1.287 billion in May due to a global rout in the bond markets.

A bulk of inflows in June happened when foreign investors reportedly infused more than $1 billion dollars on a single day when Vodafone had come out with its rupee bond issue. The fact that the net positive amount for June was still at $277.70 million, indicates there had been sell-offs too.

In July, foreign investors have so far bought $79.65 million worth of debt securities as per data from depositories till Wednesday.

Capital inflows into the most attractive government securities are limited because by August 2014, FIIs had fully utilised their investment limit that stands at $30 billion. Intermittently, limits get freed owing to redemptions or sale of bonds to domestic investors. As and when these investment limits get free, an auction is conducted for FIIs to bid for these limits.

As of July 8, FIIs have utilised 99.71% of their investment limit in government debt securities while having used 77.31% of their $51 billion investment cap in corporate bonds.

Ananth Narayan, regional head of financial markets, South Asia at Standard Chartered, believes foreign investors continue to watch for any possible hike in their investment limits in the government debt.

“While current global uncertainty would impact capital flows, India continues to be a relatively preferred destination for debt inflows, given stable macros, currency, and relatively high yields. Global investors await opening up of FII limits into govt debt,” Narayan said.

Meanwhile, there has been speculation of a possible hike in the FII investment limit in Indian debt and converting the cap to a rupee-denominated against the dollar-denominated cap that is under current practice. A DBS report said that by shifting to a rupee-denominated cap, the foreign portfolio investment limit is likely to rise by more than 25% as the existing quota was calculated keeping rupee-dollar exchange rate at 49.80.

“There was no mention of a timeline. Technical aspects need to be worked out, especially the exact rupee level at which this conversion will take place,” it said.

","In June, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) reversed their trend from May and became net buyers of Indian corporate and government bonds, with a total inflow of $277.70 million. A significant portion of this inflow occurred when foreign investors injected over $1 billion during Vodafone's rupee bond issue. In July, FIIs purchased $79.65 million worth of debt securities. However, capital inflows into government securities are restricted due to fully utilized investment limits, prompting speculation about potential increases in FII investment limits in Indian debt. Transitioning to a rupee-denominated cap could raise the foreign portfolio investment limit by more than 25%, although technical details and timelines remain uncertain. Despite global uncertainties, India remains an attractive destination for debt inflows due to stable macros, currency, and relatively high yields."
bdea49b495681788602d752bea26d39c,"[DOC 1] IT was in 1984 that hundreds of Sikhs were killed in New Delhi, following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Sajjan Kumar, who was then a Member of Parliament, has been charged, along with five others, for allegedly killing six persons in the Delhi Cantonment area during the riots that followed. The charges against the senior Congress leader were framed on the recommendation of the GT Nanavati Commission that inquired into the riots.

The wheels of justice have been excruciatingly slow in bringing the few, who were accused of the killings, to justice. In the first instance, as the court was told by the CBI prosecutor, a conspiracy, with the complicity of the police and patronage of local politicians, ensured a major cover-up. Thus, most of the perpetrators of violence managed to go scot-free. Taking the case of the Cantonment area alone, the Nanavati Commission quoted the official casualty figure at 341. A total of 385 houses, 110 shops and 45 vehicles were burnt. Yet, police officials did their utmost to minimise the magnitude of the crime, and thus, if police records are to be believed, there was no killing in the Delhi Cantonment area between October 31 and November 6, 1984. This statement did not stand the test of time.

There has never been any doubt in popular perception that there was widespread complicity in covering up a conspiracy to kill hundreds of innocent people. The fact that no prominent person was brought to book for this heinous act has made this an open wound, one that reopens at the slightest provocation. Much has healed, and many people have moved on and dealt with the aftermath of the killings of 1984. However, for those who were directly affected, there has been a sense of denial of justice. For them, the case against those accused of the killings must be taken to its logical end, without undue delay. ",The slow pace of justice in prosecuting those accused of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots has been a source of anguish. Complicity in covering up the atrocities has exacerbated the wounds. The pursuit of justice must continue without delay to bring closure and address the lingering sense of injustice.

Since then, there has been no scaling down of tensions on the LAC in eastern Ladakh, with India matching the Chinese with its deployment of man and material. In Ladakh, at least six rounds of talks have been held between Indian and Chinese military commanders on the ground but have failed to achieve a breakthrough. Sources said the Chinese, who crossed the LAC at three places, have refused to move out of Indian territory or de-escalate the tensions. In Galwan valley, the Chinese have massed troops on their side of the LAC.

17671018cdbd935bb93bbfad6fe08d1b,"[DOC 1] The voice. Picture this: The early 1980s. A cold winter night in Shillong. Two young preteen boys huddled over the radio. Tuned into the march of songs almost spurred on by a voice that seemed to be speaking only to you — ‘Behno aur bhaiyon…’ It was only later that I learnt how it was always ‘behno aur bhaiyon’, the woman first, never the other way round.

It did not strike me at the time that it was a conscious decision. Only years later would I realise the subversive element to it. It did not matter in those more innocent times. What mattered was the voice, and the sense of excitement it generated as it went about the countdown. In his voice you could almost visualise the songs climbing up and down the ‘paydaan’, and the song of the week wearing the ‘sartaaj’.

For generations of Indians growing up during the 1950s-80s, Ameen Sayani and Binaca Geetmala were a weekly getaway to music and entertainment before television and Chitrahaar changed the way we looked at both. Forty years after I last listened to the radio on a regular basis, the voice remains unparalleled.

It all began thanks to a government ban. In 1952, India’s federal minister of information and broadcasting B.V. Keskar banned Hindi film songs from the airwaves for the threat they posed to Indian culture and classical music. As Hindustani and Carnatic classical music replaced film songs, and announcements were increasingly Sanskritised, Radio Ceylon moved in to fill the gap. They got Binaca toothpaste as a sponsor and asked Hamid Sayani, studio owner and producer and Ameen’s elder brother, to conceptualise the show.

Hamid was already presenting a show of English songs on Radio Ceylon which was doing very well. There was a catch, however. The salary would be only Rs 25 per episode for researching, writing and presenting. Hamid in turn turned to his 20-year-old brother.

The birth of Binaca Geetmala

On December 3, 1952, the first episode with seven songs was aired with Ameen Sayani’s cheery voice: ‘Behno aur bhaiyon, aap ki khidmat mein Ameen Sayani ka adaab.’ Indian radio would never be the same again. The show ran for an astounding 42 years.

Binaca Geetmala was, however, not Ameen’s first brush with the radio. Hamid had initiated Ameen into the world of radio at the age of seven as a casual artist in the Bombay station of AIR. With time he would introduce the young man to commercial broadcasting for Radio Ceylon.

A weekly radio show sponsored by the makers of Ovaltine became Ameen’s break on radio as announcer. The audition did not go well as Ameen, probably because it was a health drink, read out the announcement a tad too enthusiastically prompting the producer to ask Ameen to lower his volume. Following this, Ameen passed the audition and landed his first assignment. He would not be paid, however. His remuneration: a tin of Ovaltine every week.

Born to Kulsum Patel and Dr Jaan Mohamad Sayani, Ameen assisted his mother in editing and printing Rahber, a fortnightly journal, from 1945 to 1960. Initiated by Mahatma Gandhi, the journal was published in Devanagari, Urdu and Gujarati. Mahatma Gandhi would later write to his mother: ‘I like the mission of Rahber to unite Hindi and Urdu. May it succeed.’ The work on this journal provided Ameen with the education he needed in simple communication and the confluence of the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb – a hallmark of Binaca Geetmala and other radio shows he hosted, including the weekly Bournvita Quiz Contest, which he took over after Hamid passed away, and the extremely popular S. Kumar Ka Filmi Muqaddama.

Binaca Geetmala, which became Cibaca Geetmala and then Colgate-Cibaca Geetmala, shifted to AIR’s Vividh Bharati in 1989, became a hit show from the first episode which received 9,000 letters. By the end of the first year that number had touched 60,000 letters a week. In 1954, the original competition format was jettisoned in favour of a one-hour hit parade. The new format garnered a listenership of over 10 crore. Ameen Sayani single-handedly elevated the Hindi film song to the status of an art form.

The letters from Jhumri Telaiya

It was Ameen Sayani who popularised the almost mythical Jhumri Telaiya on Indian radio. Sayani asked listeners of the show to write to him with their favourite songs and rankings, and then read out some of these letters. Writing to Binaca Geetmala became a national pastime, with the town of Jhumri Telaiya (now in Jharkhand) taking the lead. Many listeners thought that the name was a figment of Sayani’s imagination, a joke, but letters from Jhumri Telaiya assumed tsunami proportions and Sayani would often read these out. Jhumri Telaiya entered the cultural map of the country.

What made Binaca Geetmala special was not just Sayani’s voice but his erudition which he wore ever so lightly. He not only introduced the countdown format on Indian radio (predating Casey Kasem, the US presenter of the American Top 40 show, by a couple of decades), he also offered little-known peculiarities and nuggets of information about the songs he was privy to. He was a storyteller, elevating a countdown show to something aspirational, giving it the feel of a fireside chat.

Over a glittering career, he worked on over 50,000 radio programmes, countless jingles and TV shows. He played a brief role in Mehmood’s Bhoot Bangla and announced the cast in Dev Anand’s Teen Deviyan. He also forayed into writing dialogues for Sawan Kumar Tak’s Hawas but the experience left him bitter enough not to attempt it again.

Ameen Sayani belongs to an array of radio presenters in India that included stalwarts like Birendra Krishna Bhadra, Surajit Sen, Melville de Mellow, Barun Haldar, Jasdev Singh, Sushil Doshi. No one possibly knew the art of radio announcement as well as he did. His velvety voice, by turns playful, instructive and cajoling, and inherent adaab charmed listeners across ages for decades, including two young boys on a cold night in Shillong 40 years ago. It was a voice that came from the heart. And so spoke to the heart.

(Shantanu Ray Chaudhuri is a film and music buff, editor, publisher, film critic and writer)","Ameen Sayani, the iconic radio presenter and voice behind the legendary Binaca Geetmala, has left an indelible mark on Indian radio. Binaca Geetmala, a weekly radio show that aired from 1952 to 1994, was known for counting down the top Bollywood songs of the week. Sayani's velvety voice and erudition elevated the show, making it a cultural phenomenon. His contribution to Indian radio, along with his charming and engaging style, has left a lasting impact on generations of listeners."

Officials from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is in charge of maintaining both the city?s highways, claimed they were filling in craters during the dry spell.The MMRDA said it fixed 353 potholes on the Western Express Highway, which were reported between July 1 and July 10, last week.

The transfer has evoked sharp reactions from the common public in the district. It may be mentioned that 159 teachers, most of them ladies, have been transferred from Chongkham, Namsai and Lekang circles overlooking their grievances such as medical ground, old age, joint posting, children education and nearing superannuation. Some of the lady teachers, posted in the Primary schools close to the border areas, who went to join at their posting places found no accommodation facilities. Before sending recommendation, the District Education Officers should have submitted school-wise names of teachers to Itanagar by giving comments in the ‘Remarks Column’ so as to justify taking action, as done earlier.

635ee37909f891a37ad297cd12793cf8,"[DOC 1]  Take the challenge from Pakistan, a country 1/13th India’s size economically: After suffering each attack since the late 1990s, India has had the same debate, largely centred on the merit of staying put in the process of talks with Islamabad. Few ask the real questions: How many more attacks is India willing to bear? Is there no limit to India’s patience? What has outraged the country over the two recent back-to-back Pakistani acts of aggression—the suicide raid on the Indian consulate in Jalalabad and the ambush-killing of five soldiers along the Line of Control (LoC)—is more the government’s meek response and prevarications than the attacks themselves.

A key plank of Pakistan’s jihad strategy is deniability. Carry out an attack, deny involvement, keep India engaged in talks to serve as a continuing cover, and execute the next attack. This strategy can fool no one. But India’s political class is so corrupt and compromised that it has little time to look beyond self-interest.

Indian leaders are very protective of their own interests. Indeed they have an over-inflated view of themselves. Their hard-headedness in serving personal interests contrasts with their faint-heartedness in shielding national interests. If they had spent just a quarter of their time on their primary duty—protection of national interest—the country wouldn’t be in the mess it is today, with the economy sinking, national security under siege, and pessimism reigning.

The foundation of India’s weak-kneed foreign policy was actually laid between 1999 and 2004 by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who executed more policy U-turns than probably any other prime minister since independence. Vajpayee’s roller coaster policy on Pakistan exacted a major toll on institutionalized policymaking, exposing India’s inadequacy to set and unwaveringly pursue clear goals.

Under Vajpayee—who also surrendered India’s Tibet card in a 2003 Beijing visit—personal rather than professional characteristics defined foreign policy. His shifting Pakistan stance traversed through Lahore, Kargil, Kandahar, Agra, and Parliament, before culminating in Islamabad on his second trip to Pakistan as prime minister. It was Vajpayee’s 2001 Agra invitation that helped Pervez Musharraf to come out of the international doghouse for staging a coup.

In an operation with no parallel in modern history, the Indian military was kept in war-ready position for 10 months, ostensibly to force Pakistan to dismantle its terrorist infrastructure. Yet, without accomplishing any objective, Vajpayee called off the costly, self-debilitating operation, which the then Navy chief later labelled the “most punishing mistake"". Worse still, Vajpayee during his 2004 Islamabad visit hailed as a big gain Pakistan’s commitment on paper to not let its territory to be used for cross-border terrorism—the very assurance Musharraf had given before Operation Parakram began.

Vajpayee’s swinging policy pendulum emboldened his successor, Manmohan Singh—a foreign policy greenhorn—to pursue a blinkered approach that blended naiveté with appeasement, thereby inviting greater acts of aggression against India. Mistaking tactics for strategy, he has treated the process of engagement with Pakistan (and China) as an end in itself, losing sight of the purpose—putting an end to acts of aggression.

Singh’s fixation on quasi-failed Pakistan has paralleled Vajpayee’s quest to make peace with that implacable enemy. The Vajpayee and Singh eras will also be remembered for the corruption in public life, with scandals at times sought to be deflected through peace-building with Pakistan. A famous son-in-law in each of the two eras came to symbolize unbridled corruption.

Is it any surprise that personal and not professional characteristics have shaped foreign policy for almost 15 years now? This trend marks goodbye to institutionalized policymaking.

Singh, of course, has taken appeasement to unmatched levels. In 2006 at Havana, he equated the exporter of terrorism with the victim of its terrorism, setting up the infamous and now-defunct joint anti-terror mechanism. Three years later at Sharm el-Sheikh, Singh included Baluchistan in the agenda—grist for the Pakistani propaganda mill that India was fomenting the insurrection there. This blunder also allowed Pakistan to externalize the Baluch problem by turning its terrorism target, India, into the principal accused.

Even the savagery last January, when Pakistani troops chopped two Indian soldiers and took away one severed head as a trophy, failed to stop Singh from returning to business as usual with Pakistan, in spite of his own promise to the nation that it won’t be business as usual. The result is that Singh’s constant engagement of Pakistan has yielded uninterrupted Pakistani acts of military brutality and terror. In fact, the worst acts of cross-border aggression have occurred during Singh’s stint as Prime Minister.

Instead of dictating terms to Pakistan, India allows it to retain initiative. Each time India is caught by surprise, it does little more than react passively. Whereas Pakistan’s India policy has remained consistent for long, India’s ad hoc Pakistan policy continues to inflict self-injury.

Make no mistake: India has fashioned its own insecurity trap. To break out of it, it must pursue a clearheaded, goal-oriented foreign policy focused on an assertive promotion of national interests. That process can begin only if India stops looking at inter-country relations through rose-coloured glasses and establishes professional policymaking.","The article discusses India's response to acts of aggression by Pakistan and questions the effectiveness of its foreign policy, especially in dealing with Pakistan. The author criticizes the lack of a clear and assertive approach in protecting India's national interests, citing instances where political leaders prioritized personal interests over national concerns. The article highlights the historical context, pointing to Atal Bihari Vajpayee's policy shifts and Manmohan Singh's appeasement strategy. The author argues that India needs to adopt a more goal-oriented and assertive foreign policy to break out of its ""insecurity trap."" The critique extends to India's engagement with Pakistan, emphasizing the need for proactive measures rather than reactive responses. Overall, the article calls for a reevaluation of India's foreign policy approach, focusing on professional policymaking and a clear promotion of national interests."

Militants kidnapped two persons, including a special police officer, in North Kashmir late last night, an official spokesman said.

The militants shot dead Sonaullah Wani near Nallah Kunzar in Baramula district last night.

In another incident, a mine planted by the militants at Drangbal Pampore, on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway exploded, causing injuries to four schoolboys, he said.

An encounter took place between the militants and security forces near a fire station this afternoon. However, no one was injured.

He said the militants hurled two grenades towards security force pickets at Bohri Kadal and Zainakadal early this morning. No one was injured in the incident.

He said a woman was killed in an encounter between the militants and security forces at Kala Manda last evening.

Four militants surrendered along with four AK rifles, 12 magazines, 335 rounds, three pistols, three wireless sets. The security forces seized two rocket launchers and two rockets at Badgam last evening. A large cache of arms and ammunition were also recovered from the slain militants, an Army spokesman said here today.

Meanwhile, a report from Baramula said heavy shelling by Pakistani troops in northern sector since Friday evening has forced fresh migration from the areas near the Line of Actual Control.

Official sources said Pakistani troops resorted to heavy shelling from across the border in Keran, Karnah, Teetwal, Haihama and Uri sectors since Friday evening.

The sources said more than 60 artillery and mortar shells, fired by the Pakistani troops in these sectors, exploded in the fields.

They said a security jawan was injured after a shell exploded near his bunker at Haihama.

People living near the Line of Actual Control, particularly in Uri sector, migrated to safer places because of heavy shelling from across the border, the sources said.

Officials believed that Pakistani troops were resorting to heavy shelling and firing for the past week as they wanted to push more militants and arms and ammunition into Kashmir before routes closed due to snow.

Light snow early this week in the border areas had resulted in Pakistani troops intensifying shelling to give cover to the militants to sneak into this side, the officials said.

Meanwhile, work on the construction of community and individual bunkers in the border areas in North Kashmir is in progress. The authorities have decided to construct 1,000 community and individual bunkers so that people can take shelter in the event of shelling.

A spokesman said troops of the Delta Force conducted a search operation in Navapachchi forests, 40 km north of Kishtwar, in Doda district yesterday following a tip-off about the presence of militants in the forests. During the operation, the militants fired at the search party with sophisticated weapons and lobbed a number of grenades towards it while it was approaching their hideouts. The security forces returned the fire in which five militants were killed.

In another encounter, which took place between the militants and troops of 2 Sikh Regiment at Dongi Grate village in Rajouri district last evening, four militants were killed and a large cache of arms and ammunition was recovered.

The recoveries included three AK assault rifles along with 15 magazines, a pistol along with two silencers and two magazines, 11 hand grenades, seven wireless sets, a grenade launcher and more than 1,200 rounds.

Pakistani troops, meanwhile, resorted to unprovoked firing and shelling from across the border in Nowshera, R S Pora and Akhnoor sectors last evening. Pakhu Ram was injured at Pallanwala in Akhnoor sector.","In Srinagar, eleven people, including nine militants and a woman, were killed amid heavy shelling by Pakistani troops near the Line of Actual Control.

Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal today spared passengers a fare hike, but raised various charges on tickets as well as freight tariff to net in additional Rs 4,683 crore a year.

In his maiden “please-all” Budget, Bansal announced 106 new trains and a host of proposals for travel safety and comfort, such as escalators at key stations, a new e-ticketing system and swanky coaches in select trains. He proposed a slew of measures to raise internal resources while announcing the start of 67 new express trains and 26 passenger trains.

The first Congress minister to present a Railway Budget in 17 years, Bansal also announced setting up of a number of production units around the country, including some in North India. He announced the highest-ever plan outlay of Rs 63,363 crore for the public sector behemoth. Of this, Rs 14,260 crore would be raised from internal resources with Rs 26,000 crore budgetary support.

Presenting the Budget in the Lok Sabha, Bansal, who had effected an across-the-board hike in passenger fares only last month, said he did not intend to pass on the impact of deregulation of diesel price for now and the Railways will absorb a burden of Rs 850 crore on account of this.

Freight and passenger fares have to be based on economic realities. The growth of the Railways is linked to the country’s growth. The estimated losses of the Railways stood at Rs 24,000 crore in 2012-13.
— PK Bansal, Railway Minister
Nothing for poor

The poor and middle class travel more by railways. These people don’t stand to benefit much from the Budget.

— Mayawati, BSP chief

Kerala unhappy

Early this year when the Railway Minister arrived in the state, we presented our demands. We were hopeful, but now we are disappointed

— Aryadan Mohammed, Kerala Minister

Mumbai complains

It seems injustice has been done to the people of Maharashtra and Mumbai.

— Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra Dy CM

Will hit passengers

The government is claiming it did not raise fare but other charges of tatkal and cancellation etc have been increased which will adversely hit the passengers

— Nitish Kumar, Bihar CM

The minister, in his 75-minute speech drowned in Opposition slogan-shouting towards the end, said a number of supplementary charges had not been revised for the past several years. He brought about a marginal rise in supplementary charges for superfast trains, reservation fee, clerkage charge, cancellation charge and tatkal charge.

“I propose to effect marginal increase in some of these. These include supplementary charge for superfast trains, reservation fee, cancellation charge and tatkal charge,” which could bring about another hike in upper class travel indirectly.

While tatkal charges for sleeper class have been raised by Rs 15 to Rs 25 and for AC chair car from Rs 25 to Rs 50, tatkal charges in AC-3 tier have been increased by Rs 50 and AC-2 tier and executive class by Rs 100. The reservation fee for AC First and Executive classes has been raised to Rs 60 from Rs 35 and that of First Class and AC-2 doubled to Rs 50. Reservation fee for AC chair car, AC-3 economy and AC-3 tier has been increased to Rs 40 from Rs 25 and supplementary charges for superfast trains raised between Rs 5 and Rs 25.

Bansal, however, proposed to abolish the concept of enhanced reservation fee with a view to simplifying the fee structure, having already discontinued development charge in January this year.

There was, however, some tilt towards the constituency of the UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi as the minister announced the setting up of a new Forged Wheel Factory at Rae Bareli in collaboration with Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd.

This is the second unit to be commissioned in Rae Bareli after the formal commissioning of a rail coach factory there just a few weeks after the Congress got the Railway Ministry. The rail coach and wheel factories in Rae Bareli are expected to generate job opportunities in the area, a sop for the region before the next year’s General Election.

There were announcements for other regions as well which included Greenfield MEMU manufacturing facility at Bhilwara, a coach manufacturing unit at Sonepat and some other units at Kurnool, Bikaner, Pratapgarh, Misrod and Kalahandi and signal equipment facility at Chandigarh.

Focusing on safety, Bansal said the government would take significant measures to prevent accidents. “Anti-collision devices will be put to rigorous trials, 10,797 unmanned level crossings will be eliminated and no new unmanned level crossings will be set up. Fire retardant materials will be used in coaches and a new SPART train, i.e. self-propellant accident relief train will be introduced,” Bansal said. SPART would help at the time of accidents to reach the spots as fast as possible as these trains with life saving equipments would travel between 160 to 200 kms per hour. Focus would also be on the safety of women. More women will be recruited in the RPF and also be posted on trains. He proposed the filling of over 1.2 lakh vacancies in the Railways. Bansal also announced adopting 104 railway stations for upgradation and installation of escalators at key stations and a swanky coach in select trains.

The advocate-turned politician also promised a new e-ticketing system through mobile phones, SMS alerts for reservation status and free wi-fi on select trains, apart from setting a target of Rs 1 trillion for projects under public-private partnership.","In his maiden Railway Budget, Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal avoided a direct passenger fare hike but increased various supplementary charges and freight tariffs to generate ₹4,683 crore in additional revenue. The budget introduced 106 new trains, including 67 express and 26 passenger services, and proposed safety and passenger comfort upgrades such as escalators, swanky coaches, and a new e-ticketing system. The plan outlay reached a record ₹63,363 crore, with significant allocations from internal resources and budgetary support. Charges for tatkal bookings, reservation fees, and superfast train supplements were raised. The budget also focused on safety measures like eliminating unmanned level crossings, deploying accident relief trains (SPART), and enhancing fire safety. New production units were announced in Rae Bareli, Bhilwara, Sonepat, and other regions. Critics argued the budget lacked benefits for the poor and favored select constituencies. Bansal emphasized modernization, fiscal discipline, and public-private partnerships to drive railway growth."

Tarsem Singh''s story seems to have been lifted straight out of a make-believe movie. Only, it''s as real as sweat and struggle.  ""I can''t remember thinking that I wanted success. I don''t have any set things,"" says Tarsem, who drew a fair share of eyeballs at Ad Asia 2003 in Jaipur recently.  ""I know nothing about advertising. I live in my own la-la land,"" says Tarsem with a laugh, while pointing out that he doesn''t know what to do with visiting cards. ""I have never had a card.""  This man breaks the rules with such success that his ads have won him three Cannes trophies, and an early video, REM''s ''Losing My Religion'', won him MTV''s Best Video Award. Now, after directing commercials for Levi''s, Coca Cola, Lee Jeans, Polaroid, Smirnoff, Audi, Volkswagen, Lexus, Nike and Microsoft - not to mention sci-fi film The Cell, which starred Jennifer Lopez - Tarsem is working on his new movie The Fall, which involves - as is to be expected of him - ""story-telling with no rules.""  ""Forty per cent of the shooting, to begin in March 2004, will be in India; the rest in Turkey, Romania and South Africa,"" he says. The stars in The Fall are a five-year-old girl and a man.  ""I am looking for a girl across all cultures, including India. Gulshan Grover, who convinced me to shoot in India, might be a part of the project,"" says Tarsem, who draws inspiration for his latest project from Yohoho, a Bulgarian movie he saw at a film festival in Delhi 21 years back.  In town on Monday, Tarsem will address DU students at St Stephen''s. ""Nobody was lazier than me during my Hansraj days. I was just hanging out with the junkies.""  Meanwhile, Tarsem has singular advice for Bollywood. ""If you try to compete with Hollywood, you will end up like Italy or Spain - where the movie industry has been wiped out.""  While Tarsem finds Aamir Khan ""inspiring"" and Lagaan ""superb"", it''s not as if he is in love with Bollywood. ""The most soulless films are the ones for NRIs.""  Brave enough to venture into uncharted realms, Tarsem has fought back heartbreak after breaking up with his girlfriend two years ago. ""It took time to come out of the body shock. Now I am more ready for kids than a woman.""  Expect Tarsem Singh to follow his heart. Beyond music videos, ads and films, that''s what he does best.","Tarsem Singh's journey from Hansraj College to Hollywood director is a testament to his unconventional path. He pursued filmmaking against his father's wishes, taking on odd jobs to finance his education. Singh broke into the industry with award-winning music videos and commercials for major brands. His debut film, ""The Cell,"" featured Jennifer Lopez. Currently, he is working on ""The Fall,"" a story involving a five-year-old girl and a man. Singh emphasizes the importance of avoiding competition with Hollywood and creating original content.

359071de7869df694d87243c66e8bb8e,"[DOC 1] The Noida authority on Tuesday said that it has completed construction of nine ambitious infrastructure projects.

It is busy giving final touches to some of the projects so that eight of these can be opened for public use by October-end. The City Centre underpass was opened in 2015. Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is expected to inaugurate these projects through a video conference from Lucknow. On April 2, 2013, the CM had laid the foundation stone for these projects from Lucknow.

The CM had repeatedly instructed authority officials to complete these projects before the 2017 assembly elections because he wanted to brand his governance as pro-development, officials said. Successive chief secretaries and chairman of Noida authority continuously reviewed the progress of these projects to ensure that these were completed on time, officials said

“Some of the projects such as the Girls College and the City Centre underpass are already completed. I have instructed officials to complete the remaining projects, including the Model Town T-point underpass at NH-24 and redevelopment of the Noida Stadium, before October 30,” Pramod Kumar Aggarwal, chief executive officer of the Noida authority, said.

The underpass at Model Town at NH-24 and the elevated road are aimed at decongesting the city’s busy roads. Commuters have been facing longer traffic snarls due to the construction of the underpasses, elevated road and Noida stadium.

Work on the elevated road was started on October 14, 2014 but the authority has completed only half the project. The elevated road project is being built at an estimated cost of Rs. 415 crore on Master Plan-2 Road, which is one of the busiest roads in the city, officials said.

“Since the construction on the (elevated road) project was started, city’s traffic is in a complete mess. Travelling in sectors 30, 27, 31, 24, 33, 51, 58 and 61 has become very difficult due to long snarls. It will continue to trouble residents and motorists because the authority has completed only half of the project,” Guddu Chauhan of Sector 31 said.

Expansion of the Noida cricket ground was slated to be completed by 2015 but has missed multiple deadlines.

“For the last four years, the Noida authority is busy constructing a cricket stadium to seat 25,000 people. But I do not understand why it has not completed this project on time. I hope it will open the stadium for public on October 30, giving relief to those who visit it daily for a morning walk and physical exercise. It is an unpleasant experience to go for a jog while construction is ongoing,” Neeraj Kumar of Sector 12 said.

officials said that these projects will immensely benefit commuters and the residents. “We opened the City Centre underpass in 2015 as this project was completed before schedule. The project has addressed traffic congestion at this crossing. Once opened, the Model Town T-point underpass will also ease traffic congestion and benefit commuters travelling between Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi,” Hom Singh Yadav, chief engineer of the Noida authority, said.
","The Noida Authority has completed construction on nine major infrastructure projects, with eight set to be opened to the public by the end of October. These projects, including the Model Town T-point underpass and redevelopment of the Noida Stadium, were initiated in 2013 and aimed at easing traffic congestion and improving public amenities. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who laid their foundation stones, is expected to inaugurate the completed works via video conference from Lucknow. While the City Centre underpass was completed in 2015, others like the elevated road and cricket stadium have faced delays. The elevated road, started in 2014 with a cost of ₹415 crore, is only half complete, causing heavy traffic snarls in several sectors. Residents have expressed frustration over these delays but hope the remaining work will be finished soon. Officials maintain the projects will greatly benefit commuters and improve traffic flow across Noida, Ghaziabad, and Delhi."

In a joint statement at a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),the powers also voiced regret about Irans stepped-up campaign to enrich uranium – activity which can have both civilian and military purposes.

We urge Iran to fulfil its undertaking to grant access to Parchin, the statement said,referring to the military facility southeast of Tehran. Iran refused access to the complex during two rounds of talks with a senior IAEA team earlier this year.

Western diplomats suspect the Islamic state may now be trying to clean up the site to remove evidence of research with nuclear applications before possibly allowing inspectors in. The six powers handling the Iran nuclear issue are the United States,China,Russia,France,Germany and Britain.

An IAEA report last year revealed a trove of intelligence pointing to research activities in Iran of use in developing the means and technologies needed to assemble nuclear weapons,should it decide to do so. One salient finding was information that Iran had built a large containment chamber at Parchin in which to conduct high-explosives tests that the IAEA said are strong indicators of possible weapon development.

Iran,which says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes,has dismissed reports suggesting it has a nuclear weapons agenda as forged and baseless. It has suggested that the IAEA could get access,but only after a broader deal is reached on how to address all outstanding issues between Tehran and the Vienna-based agency.

Kangana on Jaya Bachchan

“Jaya Bachchan ji is a very reputed actor of our film industry. Honestly, she's known for her short temper, but at the same time, I'd like to give her the acknowledgement and due credit that in those times… you can imagine that in the 1970s, at a time when women had to roast their skin in the (harsh) lighting, she did films like Guddi back then. She sent a message of women empowerment through that. And even after that… she's one of the most dignified women in the film industry. The way she carries herself in Rajya Sabha, I feel very good that we have this kind of representation from the film industry,” Kangana said.

Kangana also addressed her past attack on Jaya Bachchan, back in 2020, the latter said in Parliament that the people employed by the film industry are themselves attacking it after the events following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. “That's fine. If we say something to each other… I believe she's elder to us. If she said something to us, we should take it in stride,” Kangana said.

Jaya Bachchan's career

Jaya Bachchan made her debut as an actor in Satyajit Ray's Mahanagar (1963). She then made her Hindi film debut with Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Guddi in 1971. After marrying Amitabh Bachchan soon after, she was cast opposite him in watershed films like Zanjeer, Sholay, Mili, Abhimaan, and Silsila. She returned to mainstream Hindi cinema in the early 2000s with Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Jaya was last seen in Karan's 2023 blockbuster, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani. Jaya is also a Padma Shri recipient, a former producer, and currently a member of the Rajya Sabha.

Meanwhile, Kangana is gearing up for the release of her next, Emergency."," Kangana Ranaut calls Jaya Bachchan one of the most dignified women in the film industry today.

All the bills were passed through voice vote and the Lower House was then adjourned for the day, amid sloganeering and display of placards by Congress-led opposition members, who stood in the Well of the House, while protesting over the Manipur issue. As soon as the House convened at 3 pm, the Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Bill, was taken up for consideration and passing. Minister of State for Home, Nityanand Rai piloted the bill.
It was passed after a short debate through voice vote. The Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Bill, 2023 seeks to amend the Registration of Births and Deaths Act,1969.
Last week when the bill was introduced in Lok Sabha, Congress MP Manish Tewari had opposed its introduction. Tewari had said that he was opposing the bill for want of legislative competence on three counts. First, it transgresses on the right to privacy, second, it transgresses on the right to the separation of powers, and third, it suffers from the malady of excessive delegation. These are my three fundamental objections (to the bill),"" the Congress lawmaker had said. The bill seeks to insert provisions for digital registration and electronic delivery of certificate of births and deaths for the benefit of public at large.
It also aims to create a national and state level database of registered births and deaths, which would help in updating other databases resulting in efficient and transparent delivery of public services and social benefits. The proposed legislation also seeks to allow the birth certificate as a single document to prove the date and place of birth of a person born on or after the date of commencement of the legislation ,for admission to an educational institution, issuance of a driving licence, preparation of a voter list, registration of a marriage, and for appointment to a post in Central or state government.

The project aims at setting up an optic fibre network that will make high speed Internet available to 20 lakh households which fall below the poverty line for free and at a concessional rate to others. It will also connect more than 30,000 government offices and educational institutions including anganvadis. In the first phase, it will connect 14,000 households — a hundred in each of the state’s 140 constituencies.  


A joint venture of the Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd and the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Ltd, the project will make use of the extensive network of the former to reach wired connections to the last household in the state.

The project will go a long way in bridging the digital divide and ensure equal opportunity to all citizens. In 2019, Kerala became the first state in India to declare access to the Internet a human right.  The state government must make sure that the project does not hit administrative hurdles.

This is particularly important, seeing as, earlier, the state made an ambitious start in other technological areas as well — established in 1990 Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram, was the first dedicated IT infrastructure in India. However, the state was unable to cash in on the early momentum and was outdone by its southern neighbours.


Kerala was also the first Indian state to enact a law for land reforms. This revolutionary measure helped two generations of Keralites come out of the clutches of the feudal system and lead a life of dignity. Not many states, excepting West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir, followed this step. In a nation where only one half of the population has access to the Internet, this Kerala story is worth emulating. ","The Kerala government's K-FON project aims to provide high-speed Internet to 20 lakh households below the poverty line for free and at a concessional rate to others, connecting government offices and educational institutions. It bridges the digital divide, ensuring equal opportunity and upholding Internet access as a human right. The project, leveraging the state's infrastructure, symbolizes Kerala's progressive initiatives akin to its past endeavors in IT and land reforms, setting a model for others to emulate."
5edb35d36d97180e597a666fd97abd92,"[DOC 1] In the wake of recent controversies where several filmmakers have locked horns with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a fresh debate has been triggered by filmmaker Shyam Benegal meeting with the officials at the Information & Broadcasting Ministry. The filmmaker met the ministry officials to check the status of the report submitted by a special committee led by him in 2016, which suggested that CBFC should limit its functioning to issuing certificates to movies and not impose censoring.While Benegal is hopeful that government will push the much required revamping of the CBFC and introduce changes in the archaic Cinematograph Act 1952, we contacted him to for clarity on any deadline given by the ministry. He tells us, ?We submitted the report in two parts?in April and October last years?and they are yet to take any action. I?ve been after them for the last 10 days but I can?t talk much because I have sworn to maintain the confidentiality of the subject until the ministry itself reacts.?He adds, ?I?d urge you to get in touch with the Joint Secretary or the secretary of the ministry or even the minister Ms. Smriti Irani and ask them what happened to the report and why haven?t they taken any action on the proposed changes.?The committee has proposed amendments such as introducing a new category called ?adult with caution? and sub-dividing existing categories into UA 12+ and UA 15+ to make the content accessible to appropriate audience. If we don?t have a rating system in between UA and A, we will suggest cuts otherwise we can?t certify.Reacting to the points mentioned in the report, Pahlaj Nihalani, CBFC chairman says, ?What the Shyam Benegal report says, I don?t agree with that because he?s not demanding the right things. If we don?t have a rating system in between UA and A, so definitely we will suggest them cuts otherwise we can?t certify [the film].?With an underlined sarcasm, Nihalani adds, ?A wrong interpretation by some unknowledgeable people that CBFC is just a certification body, as along with that there?s an act and rulebook also, which you can?t forget.?While all this is still being debated upon, we asked film frat if it?s about time that censor board should be revamped and new changed be introduced.If certification is specifically categorized, audience can self-censor  what they?d like to consumeStating that it?s ?pathetically regressive? to have an appointed board deciding on creative cuts, filmmaker Homi Adajania opines, ?It?s bizarre that some pseudo-intellectual diktat can be passed allowing a screen kiss to linger for six seconds but not eight! What happens in those two seconds? It?s all just so freaking backward.? He adds, ?If certification is specifically categorized, audience can self-censor what they?d like to consume, knowing what the film?s rating stands for and through this they will not be offended by the content.?Director Ruchi Narain, whose animated film Hanuman ?Da Damdaar faced censorship issues, quips, ?It?s the simple truth. Government should govern. Reporters should report. Film makers should make films. Certification board should certify. If you start censoring everything, you turn blank and have nothing to say.?Ruling out any possibility that Bollywood can ever be free from censorship, filmmaker Hansal Mehta says it?s sad that there?s no will to actually bring about a change. ?I heard about this draft for a bill being proposed, which will be studied by the cabinet. But when will it be tabled in the Parliament? When will it actually go through?? asks Mehta.We?ll have to push our artistic boundaries in a way that we can work within the guidelines and parameters of CBFC?Every time there a furor around a film, there?s some spoken gesture that comes through but there?s no action. I have this sinking feeling that we?ll have to live with censorship that has existed since CBFC came into existence and Cinematograph Act was formed in 1952. So, we?ll have to push our artistic boundaries in a way that we can work within the guidelines and parameters of CBFC,? he adda.In support of Shyam Benegal committee report, film critic Omar Qureshi says, ?Censorship rules and regulations are as archaic as it gets and these new recommendations are an upgradation on the lines of the American association that has PG13 and PG18 and ?approved for all audiences? as per guidelines set for movies depending upon language and adult and violence quotient.

a755cccbf4c3b45c8e8b3714edbda40e,"[DOC 1] Less than a week ago, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was visiting factories in California's Silicon Valley, eager to enlist U.S. firms in Russia's own technological revolution. All the talk was of the relative success of the “re-setting of ties'' between Washington and Moscow undertaken by the Obama administration.

But now the headlines are harking back to a very different, older, more adversarial relationship following the arrest of a network of alleged Russian agents by the FBI. Charles Kupchan, professor of international affairs at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, believes this episode “has come at a very awkward moment” — just as Moscow and Washington are in the midst of pursuing rapprochement and deepening strategic cooperation. “Nonetheless, espionage — for better or worse — remains a fixture of international politics,” Prof. Kupchan said.

“The revelation of the alleged Russian spy ring thus represents primarily a public relations challenge to the policy of re-setting relations, not a discovery that promises to scuttle improving ties between the U.S. and Russia.”

‘Unfortunate timing'
Jeffrey Mankoff, a fellow for Russian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, agrees the wider impact of this affair will in all likelihood be limited. “There are friendly countries, there are no friendly intelligence agencies,” Mr. Mankoff explained.

“The fact of widespread espionage and counter-espionage between the U.S. and Russia is a legacy of the Cold War and has little to do with the state of bilateral relations at any given moment,” he said.

Mr Mankoff accepts that the timing of this case is “unfortunate.” It threatened to take some of the glow off President Medvedev's successful U.S. visit last week, he said. He argued there would probably be a brief period of muted recriminations, but that then this episode would fade.

His colleague, Stephen Sestanovich, one of Washington's leading commentators on Russian affairs, also believes the fall-out from this affair will be limited. “In both countries espionage and counter espionage efforts are only very loosely tied to diplomacy. Both governments will want to keep the affair from taking on too much significance.”

Cold war infrastructure
For a Russian take on the affair, I turned to Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre.

His hope was that its impact would be short-lived. But in Mr. Trenin's view “both Russia and the United States still keep much more of the Cold War infrastructure than is needed by either.”

He had an intriguing point of view on the specific timing of this announcement. While most U.S. commentators have been speculating about Russian motives, Dmitri Trenin believes the timing of the announcement of these arrests is telling. Mr. Trenin sees two groups of interest in this matter. The first he says are “those in the U.S. who are unhappy about the re-set in relations, who argue that Russia is getting much more out of it and want it to slow down.”

Mr. Trenin says the second group is the “FBI, which wants to burnish its reputation after the Times Square bomb incident and the Chicago Christmas airline bomb-plot.”

Of course there are clearly different constituencies at work in Moscow, too.

As Charles Kupchan said: “When it comes to re-setting relations with the United States and with NATO, Russia's security, defence and foreign policy bureaucracy tend to drag their feet. President Medvedev seems to be in the lead on this front, pulling a reluctant bureaucracy behind him.”

Legacy of the past
Earlier this month, U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates described Russia's foreign policy as “schizophrenic.” He was referring to Moscow's ambivalent approach towards Iran's nuclear activities.

But when asked whether this might be an appropriate label to describe Russia's whole approach to the Obama administration as well, Dmitri Trenin said: “I think the U.S.-Russian relationship as a whole is somewhat schizophrenic.”

But what really worried him was the way in which the legacy of the past intruded into the present. Should we really be so surprised by these espionage allegations?

“I trust there are U.S. spies in Russia and will be for a long time, never mind the re-set,” Mr. Trenin said.

He added: “But I am even more troubled that 20 years after the end of the Cold War, Moscow and Washington are still targeted by very real nuclear missiles of the ‘other side.'The nukes may have had a real deterrence mission in the Cold War, but now it's like the light of a star that is long dead — dead but dangerous.''

Charles Kupchan too believes that Russian foreign policy has a “schizophrenic” quality to it. He said: “On the one hand, Moscow seems sincerely intent on pursuing rapprochement with the West and finding its place within the Euro-Atlantic order.”

But Prof. Kupchan said that, on the other hand, “its policies toward Georgia and missile defence and its use of its energy supplies to coerce its neighbours indicate otherwise.”

Everyone I spoke to in both Washington and Moscow wondered if the U.S. might in due course throw out the Russian handlers of these alleged agents if, that is, these diplomats are still on U.S. soil. That would be playing pretty much to form — you are found out and you walk.

If this happens maybe Moscow might reciprocate with expulsions of its own. But after that things would in all probability calm down. All of the commentators and analysts were pretty much of one mind: Both the re-set and the diplomatic “schizophrenia” in relations between Russia and the U.S. look set to continue. ","Recent espionage allegations involving Russian agents have overshadowed Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's recent visit to the U.S., which aimed to strengthen ties. Analysts like Charles Kupchan and Jeffrey Mankoff view the espionage incident as a public relations setback rather than a significant threat to improving relations. Dmitri Trenin suggests the timing might be influenced by U.S. factions dissatisfied with the reset in relations and the FBI's desire to recover from past missteps. Despite the espionage tensions, experts believe U.S.-Russia relations will likely return to their previous state of ""schizophrenia,"" balancing between cooperation and historical legacies."
8d433b81b76b3425e4625a848d530629,"[DOC 1] Rajasthan votes Saturday in an election that has gone down to the wire, with the BJP confident about its campaign targeting the Congress government on law and order and “appeasement politics”, and the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress banking heavily on the popularity of his government’s welfare schemes.

Both sides also expect that the divide might ultimately be cleaved along urban-rural lines, with the BJP holding on to its urban lead and the Congress benefiting from its schemes in villages.

What has added an extra edge to this is Rajasthan’s recent history of always voting out the incumbent.
The two people for whom these elections will be defining for their political futures are Gehlot, 72, whom the party has already tried to steer out as CM once, and Vasundhara Raje, 70, who could not get the nod as BJP CM face despite trying her best. A wary Raje has kept her cards close to her chest and not given any interview in months.
Ironically, while a comfortable victory will mean the Congress would not be able to deny Gehlot the CM post, notwithstanding Sachin Pilot, a comfortable victory for the BJP might translate into the party high command having its way in easing out Raje.
Of the state’s total 200 Assembly seats, polling will be held in 199, after the Congress candidate from Karanpur passed away.

If Gehlot, Raje and Pilot are expected to sail through, some prominent faces are facing a tough challenge from their opponents, including Assembly Speaker and Congress veteran C P Joshi (Nathdwara); Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra (Laxmangarh); and Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore (Taranagar).","The 2023 Rajasthan Assembly election is expected to be a close race between the incumbent Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

He further asked the media community to step up in its reporting and focus on government policies and schemes, to ensure the polices are implemented properly.

 “The government’s intention is always positive, however, because of few vested interest officers, the schemes and policies are sometimes not implemented properly,” he stated, asking the journalist community to be vigilant by using RTI to dig out the truth.

In his addres, Chief Executive Officer Smart City Itanagar and former journalist, Dahey Sangno reminded of media ethics and instinct to be a true journalist.

The CEO raised concern about degrading journalism quality in the state.  “Journalism in Arunachal is sub-standard now, with poor news presentation and lack of in-depth reporting,” he said, adding: “The reporters should look into their approach to the news content. There should be in-depth research and a good presentation. Avoid unwitting endorsement of wrong language and avoid sensational news.”

On the roles and responsibilities of media, he said “If we astray from this profession, the country is in great danger. People look up to us and we need to be careful”

Emphasizing on the quality of journalism and reporting in the state, APUWJ president Amar Sangno said that reporting has taken a nose-dive ever since the explosion of social media.
He said “copy-paste journalism, prioritizing paid news and unverified and biased reporting are dominant contents of almost all media houses, especially on digital platforms.”

“The basic tenets like gathering and disseminating unbiased information to the masses, to become a voice for the voiceless without fear and favors is what makes journalism a noble profession,” Sangno said, while appealing to fellow comrades to help in upholding the highest standards of journalism in Arunachal.

Sangno also stressed that the APWUJ is for the welfare and safety of working journalists, and the meagre wages, delayed salaries and deprivation of basic incentives and facilities are the major causes for paradigm shift among journalists.
He appealed to the media owners not to deprive working journalists of their basic rights. Likewise, female journalists should also not be deprived of basic rights like maternity leaves, and other related issues.

Arunachal Publishers and Broadcasters Guild president Chopa Cheda drew the attention of media bodies towards mushrooming and unregulated media organizations on digital platforms in the state.

Cheda opined that the growing number of unauthentic media houses and overnight journalists is the reason for declining of media image in Arunachal and urged media bodies to look into the matter.
Additional PRO to CM and former Echo of Arunachal Associate Editor Rup Jyoti Pater opined that mushrooming of media organizations could be taken in a positive way.

“However, the journalists who are into content creation have to have self-constraint and follow a set of principles and journalistic ethics. Journalism is a passion. A journalist who does not have the zeal and passion for journalism, should not join the profession, ” he said.

To mark the NPD, a workshop was also organised on the theme, ‘New media journalism in the present era: challenges, lessons & future.’  Speaking on the theme, special guest Pradip Phanjoubam said, “The business  section and news sections should function separately in a media organisation to maintain quality journalism.”

Resource person Soumyadip Choudhury dwelled on challenges of media and digital media.

Earlier, Arunachal Press Club president Dodum Yangfo highlighted the objective of this year’s NPD theme and informed that workshop was for the young journalists.

Chief Minister Arogya Arunachal Yojana (CMAAY) Nodal Officer Dr Nabam Peter also made a presentation on the CMAAY and offered registration exclusively to working journalists.","The National Press Day (NPD) was observed in Arunachal Pradesh by the state media fraternity, honoring the Press Council of India.

This comes as a huge relief for the school, which has already given several representations to the Directorate of Education (DoE) seeking permission to hike fee.

Justice Suresh Kait noted that the ratio of teachers to students is “very high”, as per the affiliation bye-laws of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The court was hearing a plea by teachers of Sanskriti School, who had moved the court claiming that the school was not paying them in accordance to the 7th Pay Commission (CPC).

Last year, teachers of the school had moved the court demanding hiked salaries.

On January 10, the court-appointed CA told the court that there is a financial deficit of ₹8,12, 86, 962 for the financial year 2018-2019 and ₹7, 21, 31, 884 for 2019-2020, despite the rationalisation of the fee considered and applied by the school. The report also said that the school cannot pay teachers salaries and allowances as per the 7th Pay Commission in the present circumstances.

“It is not in dispute that in the financial year 2017-18 and 2018-19, no hike of the fee was allowed by the Delhi government and the Directorate of Education despite the fact that the school made representations for hiking the fee on August 25, 2018.

“However, the said application was decided by the DoE on September 20, 2019 after more than a year, permitted to hike 20% of the fee with effect from April 1, 2019. This type of governance cannot be accepted. It leads to our system nowhere,” the judge said in his order dated January 10.

Both the DoE and Sanskriti School principal, Richa Sharma Agnihotri, refused to comment on the developments, stating that the matter is subjudice.

The court, however, noted that since the teacher-student ratio is not according to the prescribed norms of the CBSE. It directed the school authorities to give details of the contract, ad-hoc and regular teachers employed in the school.

The judge also directed the Director of Education of the Delhi government to be present in the court on the next, hearing posting it for February 17. It also directed the authorised and responsible representatives of the society and school to also remain present for that hearing.","

Naidu said the women were saving one rupee a day and the government was consciously making an effort to assist these groups by providing a revolving fund or matching grant under various programmes.
As the recovery of money from these groups was good, banks had been lending money to these groups at a low interest rate, he added. Naidu also said the government would consider the suggestion of including motherâ€™s name while entering childrenâ€™s names in records.

“RJD is the largest party in Bihar and it has five MPs in the parliament but we have not been invited to an all-party meeting on India China face-off. We want Mr. Rajnath Singh to clarify as to why RJD hasn’t been invited”, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said in a tweet on Friday.
In his tweet on Thursday evening, he had sought clarification from the PMO and Defence Ministry on the issue. “Just wish to know the criteria for inviting political parties for all-party meet on Galawan valley. I mean for the inclusion/ exclusion because our party hasn’t received any message so far”.
Invitation to political parties to attend the all-party meeting was sent on Thursday. The RJD in Bihar was excluded because the party didn’t fulfil the criteria, sources said.
Sources said that the government has set a criteria to invite political parties -- Five or more MPs in the parliament. The RJD has five MPs in Rajya Sabha but none in the Lok Sabha.
 “Being the leader of opposition in Bihar Assembly he (Tejashwi Yadav) should know the norms. In my view, he is just doing politics by raising such issues. The matter is sensitive and nobody should do politics”, a BJP insider said.
RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha argued on Twitter that “the untenable logic of five members has got exposed”. He cited the examples of several political parties which were invited to the meeting despite having fewer MPs than the RJD. “There is more to it than what meets the eye,” Manoj Jha said.
In a letter to the Prime Minister, Jha wrote, “The RJD is the principal opposition party in Bihar, which has a strategic location with neighbouring countries in the South Asian region because of the open border with Nepal. We are not just the opposition but also the largest party in the legislative assembly of Bihar”.
He further wrote in his letter, “RJD has five MPs in the Rajya Sabha, which makes us qualify this strange and arbitrary criterion of minimum of five members to be able to join a meeting called for consultation on the great concern of national security. The blatant nature of exclusion will be a matter of record as several parties with lesser number of members have been called to participate in the meeting”.",Yadav alleged RJD has been ignored despite being the largest party in the state Assembly with 80 seats and five MPs in Rajya Sabha.

tellytown. And now, we have another actor who has taken seven
years to admit to his relationship. Abhishek Bajaj, who has played
the lead in shows like 'Dil Deke Dekho' and 'Meri Bhabhi', has been
in a relationship with Akanksha Jindal, a Delhi-based girl, for the
past seven years. Ask him why he hid his relationship from the
public eye and he says, “I was never a social person. My close
friends knew that I had a girlfriend. When an actor hides his
relationship, people assume that it is because he does not want
his career to get affected by his personal life. But that was not my
reason. Actually, I was taking my time to know Akanksha better
and realised only much later that we are serious about each other.
I started dating Akanksha when I was just 19. We were too young to think of marriage then; I had to focus on my
career.”
Ask the actor when he plans to tie the knot and he says, “Maybe, in another two years. We are in love and
Akanksha is a very genuine girl, she does not wear a mask. It could even be sooner. Our parents also know about
our relationship, so we don’t have to worry about their approval anymore.”
","Actor Abhishek Bajaj, known for his roles in TV shows like 'Dil Deke Dekho' and 'Meri Bhabhi', has recently revealed his seven-year-long relationship with Akanksha Jindal from Delhi. He admitted that he kept their relationship private not due to career concerns but because he preferred a low-profile personal life. Starting their relationship at 19, both focused on their careers rather than marriage initially. However, now they are considering marriage within the next two years, with both families already aware and supportive of their relationship."
c4a8b7ed2da668bd0ea61adbd0531064,"[DOC 1] Director Kamal has been courting controversies from the day he revealed that he was planning to make a movie on iconoclast writer Madhavikutty, who was given the title ‘The love queen of Malabar’ by Merrily Weisbord. The film made headlines when Bollywood actress Vidya Balan signed the project, later dropped out of it and Manju Warrier was roped in instead.It did not end there, Malayalis fumed when Kamal was quoted in a recent interview, saying that he was happy that Vidya did not play Aami as “sexuality would have crept in”.Many questioned his movie and wondered how a portrayal of Madhavikutty sans sensuality would make sense, especially when her writings are known for her strong and unapologetic assertion of female sexuality. As the controversies and discussions continue, Kamal joins us for a candid chat:How did you go about making the film?I have been a Madhavikutty fan since my school days and had never missed a story or piece written by her. Her autobiography Ente Katha is quite revolutionary. So, when I decided to do the film, I contemplated on how to approach her character, a complex one. She had many stages in her life — her marital life followed by a life of loneliness and then her conversion to Islam. All through her personal life, she had bold opinions on women’s sexuality. Apart from unravelling Madhavikutty the woman, there is one more aspect that needs to be explored, Madhavikutty the literary figure. Her writings were confessional in nature and the pinch of nostalgia that was present in all her works, especially in her Indian-English writings, made her a renowned figure across the globe.So to begin with, I read all her books all over again. Then I did an in-depth research on what others thought about her. For that I considered people who were close to her and spoke to her three children, her younger sister Dr Sulochana Nalappatt, her close friends and writers and people related to her in different ways. I also incorporated my own views of her. It all began in 2013 and after two years of research, I could complete the script in 2016, in no time.I have taken cinematic liberties in writing it. Though it is a biopic, I would like to make it clear that it is not a documentary. It is not the real life of Madhavikutty but a fictional adaptation. People who are very close to her may have differences of opinion. But this is my film.Is it justified to fictionalise the character while making a biopic?Yes. It is possible in a creative scenario. If we consider Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi — he has fictionally adapted the story of Gandhi. The biopic of JC Daniel, Celluloid, too is a fictional adaptation. However, in Aami, I haven’t deviated from any important incidents in Madhavikutty’s life. I have not mixed my imagination in them. But there are some areas of her life which none of us know about and that’s where I have used my creative freedom.Are you prepared to face the controversies that the movie might trigger as it is Madhavikutty’s biopic? Madhavikutty herself was a topic of discussion throughout her life, so controversies will definitely be there. If controversies happen, we will have to face it. There are still a lot of rumours on her conversion and the reasons for it. We have heard many stories but none of us know what exactly happened. Also, we know about her relationship with her husband only through her words.I have used my creative freedom there and I believe as a filmmaker I have the liberty to do it.If someone has the freedom to write about Madhavikutty, a filmmaker has the freedom to make a film too on her. I have gone through the legal side. I have bought the rights from her custodians — her children and have taken their permission.In your perception, how has Manju Warrier given life to Madhavikutty?Manju has become Madhavikutty cent per cent in all aspects — be it in performance or appearance. She has got into the character and has given her best beyond my imagination. Our team believes she has done justice to the character. I am completely satisfied. I had confidence in her and that is why I roped her in, shot the film and it is now set to release. According to me, a director’s say on a film ends the day it reaches the audience. Now, let the audience decide whether Manju was able to perform the Madhavikutty they have imagined or not.While making a biopic, is it necessary that the actor portraying the character needs to have resemblance with the real person?It depends on what’s in our mind. If we really want structural and facial similarities with the real person, we should find an actor like that. For example, Gandhi was enacted by Ben Kingsley who has likeness to Mahatma Gandhi. They were lucky to get a great actor with resemblance. Of course there are many around us who looks like Gandhi. Sometimes we do not think of looks but the portrayal.Was it star value that made you zero in on Manju?It’s not just her star value. Along with it, her proven potential as an actor gave me the confidence to visualise her as Madhavikutty. We have portrayed different stages of her life and only a talented actor can do it. Before coming to Manju, we tried to cast newbies but weren’t sure if it would work well. I was sure that Manju can get into a complex character like Madhavikutty.You had said in an interview that if Vidya had played the role, sexuality would have crept in.The whole thing happened when two statements which were said in two different contexts were put together. One was made while talking about the sexuality of Madhavikutty and the other while mentioning the writer’s innocence. By combining the two, it was interpreted that I have portrayed Madhavikutty in my movie as an innocent village girl. In reality, I had never meant that.Aami has tried to bring out Madhavikutty, the writer who was the heartthrob of all Malayalis, with all the nuances of her character and persona. It throws light on the innocent Madhavikutty who has all the characteristics of a Malayali who speaks Malayalam fluently and lives as one. At the same time, it also showcases the revolutionary Madhavikutty who dared to talk about the sexual desires and needs of women and questioned the patriarchal mind set of Malayalis, their concepts of morality and hypocrisy.All I said is as a filmmaker, if Vidya, who acted in Silk Smitha’s biopic Dirty Picture, had played Aami, I would have got more freedom while portraying the sensual scenes. But Manju has a different image in Kerala and so I had my limitations while portraying those scenes. However, Manju, who has already proved that she can play characters with sexual undercurrents in films like Kannezhuthi Pottum Thottu, has performed every scene without losing the emotional aspect of the character, that too with ease.Post the controversy, many even doubted if Aami will have Madhavikutty sans sexuality.I have never said so. It cannot happen. My movie will have everything of Madhavikutty. The movie has her as how Malayalis have perceived through what we have read, heard and spoken about.However, it is very important to understand that Aami is not the adaptation of Madhavikutty’s book Ente Katha. The movie has the Madhavikutty portrayed in her autobiography as well as the Madhavikutty who has written it.We all know that there is an autobiographical element in Ente Katha. However, there is also a Madhavikutty who wrote it and later divulged that Ente Katha has a lot of fantasy incorporated in it. So, it explores both, and the viewers should watch it staying out of Ente Katha.The ideology of the film has been under suspicion ever since Vidya dropped out. Some even doubted that ‘Kamal aka Kamaluddin’ might add his politics while picturising the final years of Madhavikutty. How challenging was it for you to shoot it?It was very challenging and the entire set of controversies was created for reasons unknown to me. I cannot say if that was the reason why Vidya dropped out. Only she can answer that and I believe she will say it at some point in her life. All Vidya told me was, “I am not comfortable”. I have no idea what the reason was. She said that when there were only five more days left for the shoot.The answers to the questions whether it was fair for a professional to back out at the last moment and why she had done it would say it all. Now, that the movie is ready, let the thoughts and allegations surface. We will face it.Were you pained that people started judging the movie, even before it was released?It is the flip side of the social media era. And it is having an adverse effect on creative people, especially filmmakers. People make judgments listening to half-baked information. The prejudices and biases are born even before finding out what the reality is. On the other side, I have accepted that Aami will have to face some controversies as it deals with a very sensitive topic. As it has already created a few discussions, it will be scrutinised more. All I want to say is, watch the movie without prejudices.","The article discusses the controversies surrounding director Kamal's film on iconoclast writer Madhavikutty, recently renamed Aami. The film has faced criticism for its casting choices and portrayal of Madhavikutty's character, especially regarding her strong opinions on female sexuality. Kamal explains his approach to the film, stating it is a fictional adaptation rather than a documentary. He defends the casting of Manju Warrier as Madhavikutty and addresses the controversies surrounding the movie's production and themes. Despite the challenges and criticisms, Kamal stresses the importance of watching the film without prejudices."
22d77ca7cad1172e6a2975c1c7fb0713,"[DOC 1] As a symbol that the United States could bounce back from 9/11 and regain its global mojo, the Freedom Tower hasn't exactly worked as planned. Possibly the only “freedom” now associated with New York's Twin Towers replacement is budgetary: it is unofficially the most expensive office tower ever built, having now cost approximately $3.8bn, almost twice the original estimate. And it's not finished yet.

Displacing the Empire
This week, the Freedom Tower at least became Manhattan's tallest building, eclipsing the Empire State Building, which regained the position after 9/11. The comparison does it no favours. Opened in 1931, the Empire State Building is everything the Freedom Tower isn't: cost-effective (eventually), elegant and universally adored. It took weeks to design and less than two years to build.

Simply deciding on an architect for the Freedom Tower took longer than that. Legal wrangles between the public competition winner, Daniel Libeskind, and the developer's choice, David Childs, got things off to a bad start in 2003. They pledged to work together, but Libeskind later compared the relationship to border negotiations between North and South Korea.

The tower's aspirations have been shackled from the outset. How could one building both symbolise the U.S.' comeback and honour the dead of 9/11? Libeskind's initial scheme ramped up the “freedom” aspect, paying tribute to the Statue of Liberty and setting a symbolic height of 1,776ft (541m), a nod to the year America declared independence. Somehow, that turned into the paranoid corporate obelisk we see today. There were security issues that called for fortified stairwells, blast-resistant glass and an impregnable concrete base to protect the building from street-level attacks.

If the Freedom Tower represents anything, it's that bygone era when Osama bin Laden was public enemy number one, and the fear was that Wall Street would be occupied by al-Qaeda rather than students protesting about financial mismanagement. The Empire State Building was also built during a recession, but back then the greatest public enemy was Al Capone. Prohibition was about to end, the New Deal was on the way, and everyone was too busy thinking about making money to agonise over the past. In retrospect, that looks like freedom. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2012","The Freedom Tower, intended to symbolize the United States' resurgence after 9/11, has faced challenges, becoming unofficially the most expensive office tower at approximately $3.8 billion, nearly double the initial estimate. Despite recently becoming Manhattan's tallest building, surpassing the Empire State Building, it is unfavorably compared to the cost-effective, elegant, and beloved Empire State Building, which took less than two years to build. The Freedom Tower's troubled history includes prolonged architect selection, legal disputes, and shifting design aspirations. The building's focus on security measures reflects an era dominated by concerns about terrorism. It serves as a symbol of a bygone era shaped by the fear of attacks on Wall Street."

This verdict brings a significant development in the long-standing legal battle over the riots that followed the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The acquittal has sparked varied reactions, with some viewing it as a setback for justice for the riot victims, while others see it as a confirmation of the accused's innocence due to lack of evidence.

3d1a5810bcfbcf1922a9be2c02ca39c2,"[DOC 1] NEW DELHI: Amid speculation that the government may be working to bring a law to regulate population, the health ministry has stressed no such plan is on the cards.Sources said that Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya is strongly opposed to the idea of regulating population by force at a time when campaigns and awareness creation are showing results and have led to a dip in numbers, top official sources said.“We are not working on any proposal to bring a law or a policy on population control,” a senior health ministry official told TOI.India’s total fertility rate (TFR) has declined from 2.2 in 2015-16 to 2.0 in 2019-21 — indicating average number of children per woman — which is below the replacement fertility level of 2.1. The latest NFHS-5 data also shows that women of all religious communities are now on average giving birth to fewer children than in the past.The health ministry’s stand assumes significance in the wake of recent comments by Union minister of state for food processing Prahlad Patel that there could soon be a law on population control. Patel's remark sparked a buzz about a shift from the stand government had taken in Parliament this year where Mandaviya argued against the need for a law in view of the decline in population growth. It grew when BJP chief J P Nadda recently said that discussions have been on and that the process of making a law takes time.When asked about Nadda's comment, health ministry officials refused to comment saying that they are unaware of the context in which he spoke and; more specifically, the question that he responded to. They, however, felt that Nadda's reference could be to the aspiration of BJP governments in UP and Assam to have a population policy.According to NFHS-5 data, while India has made significant progress in population control measures in recent times, there are wide inter-regional variations with five states still not having achieved a replacement level of fertility of 2.1. Bihar (2.98), Meghalaya (2.91), Uttar Pradesh (2.35), Jharkhand (2.26) and Manipur (2.17) are the five states, according to the NFHS-5 conducted from 2019-21.In April this year, Mandaviya had firmly opposed a private member bill by BJP’s Rakesh Sinha in Parliament, which sought to enforce a two-child rule with penal provisions for violations to stabilise the country’s population.Mandaviya had told Rajya Sabha that instead of using “force (jabran)”, the government had successfully used awareness and health campaigns to achieve population control. The bill was withdrawn following Mandaviya’s intervention.Arguing against the need for a population control law, health ministry officials say the results of the National Family Health Survey and census are indicative that population growth has declined over the years and that the government’s efforts are in the right direction.","The Indian government is not planning to implement a law to regulate population, as confirmed by the Ministry of Health. Despite earlier hints by some ministers, including the possibility of a population control law, the Health Ministry officials stressed that no such proposal is being worked on. Recent data shows a decline in India's total fertility rate, indicating a reduction in the average number of children per woman. The government's current approach focuses on awareness campaigns and health initiatives rather than enforcing a population control law, with significant progress already made in certain regions towards achieving replacement fertility levels."

Still a hot favourite of radio buffs in and around central Kerala, the station began its broadcast on November 1, the state formation day, in 1989.

Though a large number of private players have entered the field, the public broadcaster is far ahead in terms of revenue and popularity, AIR officials said.
The Kochi FM station is now gearing up to mark the jubilee by launching a number of new programmes, Station Director Balakrishnan Koyyal said.

""We are planning to celebrate the silver jubilee by airing a number of new programmes and organising some cultural events for our audience. Their unconditional support and valuable suggestions are our sole strength in this two decades of service,"" he told PTI.

An audio-history of Kochi, a 'kathaprasangam' series, a 'kavyasandhya', a folk fest, and a seminar on women issues are on the cards to mark the occasion, he said.

A get-together of all the staff of the Kochi station, including retired broadcasters will be held at the AIR campus in Thrikkakara in Kochi on November 1, he said.

He said though private FM stations posed challenges, the Kochi FM could retain its traditional audience and caught the attention of youth through quality content.

""It is natural to face some challenges in the initial days as we were the only players in the field then. We suffered the same challenge during the entry of private TV channels also. But their entry has created a healthy competition in the field which in turn helped to improve the quality of our contents,"" he said.

Sreekumar Mukhathala, a programme executive of the station, said Kochi FM caters to the interest of all kinds of audience, be it high-profile, downtrodden or youth.

""Private FMs have their limitations. They have to pay more attention to their profit. But as a public broadcaster, we can give more priority to the interests of our audience. It is the main reason behind the success saga of our FM station,"" he told PTI.

A programme titled 'FM Diary', which began during the time of the launch of the station two decades ago, is still being aired.

In addition to the major programme zone of Ernakulam district, AIR's Kochi FM is available in Pathanamthitta, Palakkad, Idukki, Alappuzha, and major parts of Kottayam, he added.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond dropped to a 13-month low of 8.23% in intra-day trade on Monday with investors betting that the steady fall in global crude oil prices and easing inflation will prompt the central bank to act.

A whopping 18% fall in the price of Brent crude oil in the international market over the last three months will not just help narrow India?s twin deficits but also help arrest inflation.

Consumer inflation dropped to 6.46% in September, a 33-month low, while wholesale inflation fell to a five-year low of 2.38%. Food inflation, which has a 50% weight in the CPI, came off to 7.67% in September. Hitendra Dave, head of global markets at HSBC, points out that the data on inflation and crude oil prices should make the RBI more confident that inflation will be reined in.

The RBI aims to bring down inflation to 8% by January 2015 and 6% by January 2016. Meanwhile, non-food credit, which had hit a five-year low of sub-10% in September, has recovered marginally to 11.16%. Most bankers say that loan offtake for capital expenditure is negligible indicating that recovery in industrial growth is slow.","The bond markets anticipate a repo rate cut by December despite RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan's reservations.

Reading a letter from Mr. Trump's physician, Ms. Leavitt said at a press briefing that an ultrasound on the president's legs ""revealed chronic venous insufficiency ... a common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70.""

Ms. Leavitt said there was ""no evidence"" of more serious conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. Additional exams identified ""no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness,"" Ms. Leavitt said.

Ms. Leavitt said Mr. Trump was not experiencing discomfort due to the condition.

According to the National Library of Health's MedlinePlus website, ""Venous insufficiency is a condition in which the veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart.""

The condition ""tends to get worse over time"" but ""can be managed if treatment is started in the early stated stages,"" the website says.

Ms. Leavitt also said that Mr. Trump had experienced bruising on the back of his hand.

“This ship is going full steam ahead. And it takes time to turn the ship around,” Dr. Peters said.

The planet is already about 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer now than it was from 1850 to 1990. Given current temperature and emissions trends, the world has about seven years before it uses up its “carbon budget,” or becomes more than 50 percent likely to surpass a temperature rise of 1.5 degrees, the new report found. Other recent studies have issued similar warnings.

Ahead of COP28, the United States and China, which together account for more than a third of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, reached an agreement to ramp up their solar, wind and other renewable energy with the goal of replacing fossil fuels. The agreement is not binding and does not specify how the countries will enforce and reach this goal.

“These joint agreements are positive and essential, but not sufficient,” Dr. Le Quéré said.

At the climate summit, she said she will be looking for countries to agree to phase down fossil fuels — not just coal, but oil and gas, too — on a specific and rapid timeline. On Saturday, 118 governments pledged to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency worldwide while reducing fossil fuel use, although China and India abstained. Some negotiators are pushing to include the pledge in the final decision document from COP28, but doing so would require consensus from all countries present.

The PHF confirmed that the FIH this week imposed a fine of 170,000 euros on Pakistan at the last executive board meeting of the world body for not sending the national team for the Pro League matches in Argentina, Australia and New Zealand.
PHF secretary general Shahbaz Ahmed said Wednesday that he has requested the FIH to reduce the fine and allow it to be paid in instalments.
“I told the FIH members that when didn’t have funds to send the team for the Pro League, how could we pay such a huge fine? I tried to convince the FIH members that they need to understand the crisis Pakistan hockey is going through and they should be at least giving us support instead of imposing any fines,” Shahbaz said.
“For the moment, I am relieved FIH didn’t ban us but I will continue to lobby to at least allow us pay the fines over instalments,” said Shahbaz, a former Olympian and captain.
The FIH, however, has given the PHF time until June 20 to pay the fine or else the penalty would be doubled.
The PHF has been under fire since the World Cup in India last December where the team finished at 11th position with the government also refusing to release any more funds for the game.
Just recently, the PHF was forced to postpone its National Hockey Championship in Karachi which was due to begin from April 20 for the same reason.
Shahbaz is a member of the FIH Executive Board which is headed by India’s Narinder Batra.

2945ca2f3215d1a9efae02b66011f49e,"[DOC 1] New Delhi : Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers who died in the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir a year ago to the day on Friday, as the Congress and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) engaged in a political slugfest.

“Tributes to the brave martyrs who lost their lives in the gruesome Pulwama attack last year. They were exceptional individuals who devoted their lives to serving and protecting our nation. India will never forget their martyrdom,” Modi wrote in a Twitter post.

The CRPF joined the prime minister in recalling the victims of the attack, in which a man drove an explosives-laden car into a truck carrying the troopers in Pulwama. “We pay our heartfelt tribute to all the martyrs. CRPF is a brave fighting force on the federal grid and remains undeterred by any untoward incident,” CRPF director general AP Maheshwari, said.

The Pulwama suicide car bombing, for which the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group owned responsibility, was the deadliest single attack in 30 years of insurgency in Kashmir. It heightened tensions in the subcontinent, and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. On February 26, 2019, the Indian Air Force (IAF) bombed a Jaish terrorist camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan, followed by a dogfight the following day over the Line of Control in Kashmir.

The Congress raised questions about the attack and the inquiry into it, and asked why the report on it was not being made public.It has previously alleged that the BJP had tried to gain political and electoral mileage out of the Balakot strikes by the IAF.

“Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the #PulwamaAttack, let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack?” former Congress president Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the entire nation paid homage to the martyrs of Pulwama; still, many questions remain about the attack.

“Why is the report of Pulwama attack not being made public? Who is accountable? Who brought the 350 Kgs IED? Why were intelligence reports of attack ignored?” he tweeted. IED is short for improvised explosive device.

The BJP was quick to hit back, with minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy accusing Gandhi of insulting security forces. “Did surgical strike or airstrike ever take place under the Congress rule? For the first time, Pakistan is afraid of us. Rahul Gandhi has insulted security forces by commenting on them,” he said.

And, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said Gandhi had chosen to target not just the government but even the security forces at a time when the nation was paying tributes to those killed in the Pulwama attack.

“When nation is paying homage to martyrs of dastardly Pulwama attack, Rahul Gandhi, a known sympathizer of LeT & Jaish-e-Mohammed, chooses to target not just the government but security forces as well. Rahul will never question real culprit, Pakistan. Shame on you Rahul,” tweeted Narasimha Rao.

Even the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), questioned the government about the inquiry report on the attack and demanded accountability, accusing the BJP of seeking votes in the name of the CRPF personnel killed in the attack. “Where is the Inquiry report one year on after the terror attack? Who has been held accountable for the loss of so many lives and the massive intelligence failure?” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said.

Separately, the CRPF said on Friday that the families of all its personnel who died in Pulwama had been paid dues ranging from ~2-3 crore and were getting the last pay drawn as monthly pension, except one over which a case is pending in the courts because of questions over who the legal heir is.

The victims were honoured on Friday with a memorial at the Lethpora camp of the force, close to the location of last year’s attack, in a solemn and emotive ceremony. The memorial is inscribed with the names of all the 40 troopers along with their photographs and the motto of the Central Reserve Police Force -- ‘Seva and Nishtha’ (Service and Loyalty).

Maharashtra’s Umesh Gopinath, who undertook a 61,000 km journey to meet the families of the 40 troopers, collected soil from their homes in an urn and presented it to the CRPF at the ceremony.","On the first anniversary of the Pulwama terror attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the CRPF paid homage to the 40 martyred troopers, while the Congress and BJP clashed over unanswered questions on intelligence lapses and accountability.

Key Points:
PM Modi tweeted, ""India will never forget their martyrdom,"" honoring the CRPF personnel killed in the 2019 suicide bombing (claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed).

Congress demanded transparency:

Rahul Gandhi questioned who benefited from the attack and why the inquiry report remains undisclosed.

Randeep Surjewala raised concerns over intelligence failures and the 350kg IED’s source.

BJP hit back, accusing Gandhi of ""insulting security forces"" and sympathizing with terrorists.

CPI(M) also criticized the government for withholding the inquiry report and exploiting martyrs for votes.

CRPF Memorial unveiled at Lethpora camp, bearing the names and photos of the 40 troopers. Families received ₹2-3 crore compensation and pensions.

Political Fallout:
The debate reflects lingering tensions over security failures and whether the Balakot airstrike was politicized ahead of the 2019 elections"

Mumbai Saga does not deviate, and will not disappoint his fans. However, the latest film is certainly one of his most laid-back one.

Full of tropes from Sanjay's typical gangster films, Mumbai Saga features John Abraham, Emraan Hashmi, Prateik Babbar, Mahesh Manjrekar and Kajal Aggarwal in important roles. Suniel Shetty and Gulshan Grover also have small but interesting roles in the film.

While the movie is full of cliches and predictable sequences, there were a few moments that had us in splits. After delivering some of the most serious dialogues, mouthed in the most grievous manner, John would flash a sly smile. Only Sanjay, or John can explain if he was simply smiling as he imagined audiences clapping for each of those.

Here are five of the most cliched, oft-used dialogues that featured in Mumbai Saga:




1) Yeh tumhari lakshmanrekha hai ... Sita ne paar ki toh Ramayan chidhi thi ... tum karoge toh Mahabharat (This is your limit, you may start a war if you cross this)

Just as he sets out to mark his territory as a don in Mumbai, John says this to a local politician.

2) Kabhi suna hai andhere ne subah ane se roka hai? (Have you ever seen the darkness stop the morning from coming?)

John is sent to jail, before turning a don and one convict threatens him with his life. This is what he had to say.

3) In seedhiyon ko dekho. Hum dono ek jagah khade hain, fark itna hai ki tu neeche ja raha hai aur mai upar (Look at these stairs. We are both at the same place, the difference is, you are going down and I am going up)

4) Bandook toh sirf shaunk ke liye rakhta hoon ... darane ke liye naam hi kaafi hai (I keep the gun because I like that, my name is enough to scare you)

A person asks John if he is out to scare people with the help of a gun. This is his reply.

5) Time toh har kisi ka aata hai ... mera daur aayega (Everyone's time comes someday, an era will be mine)

When told that he must wait for his time to come, John says this.","

Featuring John Abraham, Emraan Hashmi, and Kajal Aggarwal, the film is packed with clichés and predictable scenes but has moments of unintended humor, especially with John Abraham’s sly smiles after serious lines. Some of the most memorable dialogues include iconic threats, metaphors about rising and falling, and declarations of impending power — all classic Sanjay Gupta tropes that fans will recognize and enjoy.

a7a9a68ac168c8a431d51bb3bc490984,"[DOC 1] Apart from the political vacuum created by the denaturing of Article 370 and the stifling of dissenting voices, and the devastation of the economy, the Year of Abrogation of Kashmir’s special status within the Indian Union has brought a legal upheaval in the Valley. New Delhi has in unseemly haste introduced several new laws and altered many existing ones in the sundered entity called Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), much to the dismay of vast sections of the population.

The authorities insist the enactments are legally sanctioned and follow the pattern set by the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution. But people in the Kashmir Valley as well as in Jammu ask why not a single such law has been introduced in Ladakh, which was hived off the state.

With no one in the government even attempting to answer this justifiable question, people tend to believe that the changes wrought to J&K’s statute are ill-intentioned. Especially, the new domicile law introduced earlier this year has triggered fears that this is the beginning of demographic changes sought to be brought about in the predominantly Muslim J&K.

Reports pouring in from the plains of Jammu say thousands of non-local people have been granted domicile certificates during the past couple of months. The beneficiaries include IAS officers, their family members, refugees from erstwhile West Pakistan and members of the Balmiki Samaj and the Gorkha community.

Domicile rules

Under the new domicile law, all those persons and their children who have resided in J&K for 15 years or studied here for seven years and took the class 10 or 12 examination in an educational institution in the UT are eligible for domicile.

Children of central government officials, All India service officers, officials of PSUs and autonomous bodies of Central government, public sector banks, officials of statutory bodies, central universities and recognized research institutes of the central government, who have served in J&K for a total period of ten years can also be issued domicile certificates.

Besides, migrants and their children who are registered with the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner are being granted domicile certificates. Children of those residents of J&K who reside outside the UT in connection with their employment or other professional or vocational reasons have also become eligible for grant of domicile status.

While various political and social groups in Jammu have publicly expressed apprehensions that they might lose their land and identity as a consequence of the new domicile law, the dominant public view in the Valley is that India is transforming Kashmir into another Palestine.

“There are instances which clearly indicate that the government of India is following in the footsteps of Israel to change the demography of J&K and assimilate it socially and culturally after altering its Muslim majority character.  People are worried,” said Noor Ahmed Baba, political analyst and former professor in the University of Kashmir’s political science department.

Jammu & Kashmir’s mainstream parties including the National Conference (NC), People’s Democratic Party (PDP), People’s Conference besides the CPM and separatist organizations too have termed the issuance of domicile certificates to non-locals as the first major step towards changing the demography of the state and as a move “planned by the government at the behest of the RSS”. The J&K National Panthers’ Party which enjoys public support mainly in Jammu too has strongly opposed the new domicile law.

They say the issuing of domicile certificates to non-locals is “ill-advised, arbitrary and dishonest” as the Supreme Court has yet to decide on a series of petitions challenging the abrogation of Articles 35A and 370. They caution the government that its “misadventure” is fraught with grave consequences for the state and the country as a whole.

However, some political groups including the Panun Kashmir which claims to represent displaced Kashmiri Pandits have welcomed the new domicile law on the premise that this would end decades of discrimination meted out to sections of people living and working in J&K including those in the armed forces and the progeny of permanent female residents of the erstwhile state married to non-locals.

Political reaction

Endorsing this view, Jammu’s divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said, “Many, many people who have been residing in J&K for more than 70 years but were deprived of their legitimate citizenship rights will be benefited which is something all should welcome.”

However, CPM leader Muhammad Yusuf Tarigami warned, “Changing the demography of J&K, plundering its people of their identity and going back on constitutional guarantees and commitments of the country’s leadership which provided the basis for the state’s accession will only invigorate alienation”.

The PDP spokesman alleged, “As the agenda unfolds, it becomes clear that along with the intended demographic change, the target is also jobs, natural resources, cultural identity and everything that the people of J&K tried to save by acceding to India with firm constitutional guarantees.”

His counterpart in the BJP, Anil Gupta, however, rejected the criticism as “unfounded, motivated and part of a misinformation campaign aimed at misleading people for political reasons.” He said, “The new domicile law will neither change the demography nor snatch the jobs of the local youth. It will, however, end certain discriminations and injustices which were there but went against the constitutional guarantees.”","The abrogation of Article 370 and the introduction of new laws in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) have led to significant legal and demographic changes in the region. Under the new domicile law, individuals residing in J&K for specified periods or with certain qualifications are eligible for domicile status, including non-local government officials and their children. This has sparked concerns about potential demographic changes and loss of identity among the local population, particularly in the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley. While some political groups view the law as addressing historical injustices, others see it as a deliberate attempt to alter the region's demographic composition. Critics argue that such changes undermine the constitutional guarantees and commitments made to J&K, potentially fueling further alienation and unres"

Newly-elected ICC Chairman Jay Shah says he will look to ensure that Test cricket forms the ""bedrock"" of the game in his tenure during which he will also try to ""dismantle barriers that have hindered cricket's progress"".

The 35-year-old will relinquish his current position of BCCI secretary to succeed incumbent Greg Barclay on December 1 as the youngest ICC Chairman for a term of two years.

 Ten million ways to give Test cricket the boost it needs

""While the T20 is a naturally exciting format, it is equally important that Test cricket remains a priority for everyone as it forms the bedrock of our game,"" Shah said in a statement issued by the BCCI on Tuesday.

""We must see to it that cricketers are driven to longer format and our efforts will be channelised towards this goal,"" he added.

Shah said he would also like to work towards setting up a separate program for talent search. He emphasised on lifting the standard of the game across the globe.

""I want to assure you that I will do everything possible to elevate the standard of our game across the globe. As I step into this pivotal role, I am resolutely committed to meeting your high expectations and dedicating myself to the beautiful game of cricket,"" he said.

Shah, who is the son of union home minister Amit Shah, will relinquish his position as the BCCI secretary at the board's Annual General Meeting likely to be held towards the end of next month or in October.

Shah became the fifth Indian after the late Jagmohan Dalmiya, Sharad Pawar, N Srinivasan and Shashank Manohar to be elected for the high-profile job.

""It is my privilege to lead the ICC during such an exciting period in our shared journey,"" he said.

During his tenure as the ICC Chairman, Shah said he would advocate for the growth of women's and differently-abled cricketers.

""We must champion the ICC's mission further by allocating more resources and attention to Women's Cricket and Differently-abled Cricket. Together, we can empower these essential facets of the sport, making them not just visible but vibrant and thriving.""

With the Cred stock exchange's new valuation, $91 million would yield $1.6 percent more, and $100 million more than the current high of $89 million. But the current-high valuation of Cred for the public traded bank's New York business may be much higher, with the daily sales target of $2 billion. After all, at its current valuation, Citigroup would yield $16,839 to $18,843 per share in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Cred's current stock price has jumped sharply since it began trading under the public option trading on Dec. 18, 2013.

Related: Who's buying a $4.5 billion New Jersey school board seat?

To understand how the bank would raise its net worth, let's review past Cred holdings. In 2012, the price of New Jersey's stock was $30,744. The value of the stock traded at a total valuation of $917,880 in its earliest days at $3.49 per share, which has never been reported in capital markets, according to the website of Standard Chartered Securities.

So as the price of the stock increased from its market peak before New Jersey became a state entity in 1999, its value increased exponentially. If its valuation of New Jersey's stock has grown over time to $94 million in total, that amount is today's $917,880 total worth of New Jersey's $917.7 billion net worth. Of course, many have questioned whether such a valuation level is actually the way the bank would raise its earnings and earnings per share.

""If the bank keeps doing well to raise its earnings per share from the current high to the new low — what would the value of New Jersey be if its earnings per share were 50-50 in 2000?"" asked Michael Rennan, a C-Strom analyst at Credit Suisse.

At its current valuation, though, ceding its stake in a small national business that has been trading at a gain of 1.33 percent over the past three years is not necessarily a good sign for New Jersey. There was a clear rise in Cred's stock price in 2014, and earnings from that rise will likely decline further.

In April, however, the New Jersey Board of Regents took a $17 billion settlement in a civil case seeking reinstatement of an $84 million mortgage secured by a Cred subsidiary. The firm charged the government for $50 million in unpaid fines and restitution to banks that lent its businesses to customers, then settled.

Other Cred clients have also been offering more generous settlements to the state and given more access to information about their business owners. One such client was a large lender, National Bank of America, that raised the next-highest price by as much as 34 percent to a $17 billion settlement the day after the settlement was announced.

Related: The big picture on Wall Street with big financial transactions

Bank of America, one of few major banks with a global history of questionable financial practices, agreed to settle about $8.9 billion with the Federal Communications Commission, making it the first major U.S. company to offer such a settlement.

Rennan has estimated that New Jersey will end up with more than $700 million in unpaid liabilities, with some of that coming from Cred if the bank defaults. His estimate is based on what he expects the average Cred customer will pay:

""Even at the current valuation — an estimated $1.1 billion at the average Cred customer — the cost of a default would still rise to $1.8 billion, which is more than 40 times the current average cost of a default of this size,"" Rennan said. ""The Cred customer would pay $7.5 million — a significant increase over the current average price of $1.4 billion.""

At a similar level, an independent trader has estimated that the U.S. Department of Justice under a law requiring banks to disclose what information they gave customers if they foreclosed on homes or farms could mean that the average borrower will owe $4,079.13 in default. This would be less than the average Cred customer today.

Another expert has estimated that if an average customer is charged more than $5,000 a month for the same bank, Cred is not making a profit — it is increasing its debt to compensate customers. The bank is still paying off its debt, but as the Cred stock exchange's value has risen to $4.9 billion (and $5.1 billion today), a buyer would probably owe more than the current high.

By contrast, the total amount of outstanding government debt, a term commonly used in the U.S., is $2",", adds $500k to private-equity fund With the Cred stock exchange's new valuation, $91 million would yield $1.6 percent more, and $100 million more than the current high of $89 million.

They have sought Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's intervention in getting jobs, saying if this does not happen, the ambition of late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to produce technical hands from Amethi and help them in getting jobs would remain a dream.

Surprisingly, Rahul Gandhi has so far not found time to listen to the problems of these students. He has only conveyed his assurances to them. These first batch students, who would get their degrees this year, are full of anxiety, and not without reason. Though only two months remain for the conclusion of their undergraduate programme, not a single company has come to offer placements to the chemical branch students while for the petroleum branch, only a single company has come for campus placements. Majority of students are yet to get a job offer.

The students say that PSUs (public sector undertakings) make recruitments of professionals only on the basis of GATE score but petroleum engineering is not among the 22 disciplines in which the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering is conducted. Thus, despite the professional degree, these students are ineligible for applying for recruitment in PSUs. The students also allege that because of lack of infrastructure in the institute, they are at a disadvantage as many private internship and placement companies lay primary stress on infrastructure. The students also blamed the slipshod working of the institute's management for the delay in their getting job offers.

""The placement brochures submitted by February 2013 were officially prepared by October 2013, and sent by November, 2013. However, most of the private firms complete their recruitment process by this time. The lack of interest of the institute can be gauged by the fact that even after Shell India's confirmation to hold campus recruitment, they were not informed about the profile being offered,"" they said.

The students also criticised the institute's placement committee for not taking its work seriously. ""It calls only small-scale companies which are expected to turn down the offer, being unaware of the institute,"" the students said while hitting out at the committee for giving false assurances to them. They also decried the lack of facilities in hostels.

00967e025cbb4372fcc32986e917b650,"[DOC 1] People who skip breakfast and eat dinner near bedtime may have worse outcomes after a heart attack, a study has warned.

The study found that people with the two eating habits had a four to five times higher likelihood of death, another heart attack, or angina (chest pain) within 30 days after hospital discharge for heart attack.

The study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, is the first to evaluate these unhealthy behaviours in patients with acute coronary syndromes.

Skipping breakfast was observed in 58 per cent, late-night dinner eating in 51 per cent, and both behaviours in 41 per cent.

The study enrolled patients with a particularly serious form of heart attack called ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

""One in ten patients with STEMI dies within a year, and nutrition is a relatively inexpensive and easy way to improve prognosis,"" said Marcos Minicucci, of Sao Paolo State University, Brazil.

Minicucci recommended a minimum two hour interval between dinner and bedtime.

""A good breakfast is usually composed of dairy products, a carbohydrate, and whole fruits,"" he said in a statement.

""It should have 15 to 35 per cent of our total daily calorie intake,"" said Minicucci.

The study included 113 patients with a mean age of 60, and 73 per cent were men.

Patients were asked about eating behaviours on admission to a coronary intensive care unit.

Skipping breakfast was defined as nothing before lunch, excluding beverages, such as coffee and water, at least three times per week.

Late-night dinner eating was defined as a meal within two hours before bedtime at least three times per week.

Minicucci noted that late-night dinner eating was defined by the two-hour interval between dinner and bedtime, rather than eating late at night.

However, nearly all participants with this habit were late-eaters.

Previous studies have found that people who miss breakfast and have a late dinner are more likely to have other unhealthy habits such as smoking and low levels of physical activity.

""Our research shows that the two eating behaviours are independently linked with poorer outcomes after a heart attack, but having a cluster of bad habits will only make things worse,"" said Minicucci.

""People who work late may be particularly susceptible to having a late supper and then not being hungry in the morning,"" Minicucci said.

""We also think that the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and endothelial function could be involved in the association between unhealthy eating behaviours and cardiovascular outcomes,"" he added.","A study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology has found that people who skip breakfast and eat dinner close to bedtime may have worse outcomes after a heart attack. The research, which enrolled patients with a serious form of heart attack called STEMI, found that those with these eating habits had a four to five times higher likelihood of death, another heart attack, or chest pain within 30 days after hospital discharge. The study suggests that simple dietary changes, such as avoiding late-night meals and eating breakfast, could improve prognosis after a heart attack."

Those who do not want to
deposit the entire money, will be considered later in another draw of plots in some other area,"" industries commissioner Jalaj Srivastava said. The department has taken out a public notice asking all such industries which have not paid up, to relocate by April.

Following a public interest litigation on industries running in non-conforming areas, the state government had earlier filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that relocation of industries would be done by April 30.

But the process has moved very slowly. Of the 16,000 industries that were allotted plots in Bawana, 3,500 have taken possession of the plots. Only 200 have started construction. Altogether 10,000 industries have paid in full, while the rest have just made part payments. The government had initially identified one lakh industries running in non-conforming areas. Of these, 26,000 had been shortlisted for relocation.
","Over 6,000 industries in Bawana face the risk of losing their plots for not completing their payment obligations. The state industries department is keen on enforcing relocation of these industries, which is set to take place in just five weeks. Those industries failing to deposit the full payment may be considered later in another plot allocation process in a different area, with a preference given to those on the waiting list. A public notice has been issued by the department to urge non-compliant industries to relocate by April. This action is a response to a public interest litigation regarding industries operating in non-conforming areas, and the state government had committed to relocating these industries by April 30. However, the progress has been slow, with only a fraction of the allotted industries having taken possession of their plots or initiated construction. Out of the initially identified 26,000 industries for relocation, only 10,000 have paid in full."
253f42453649b5ac6e7e45559a18a778,"[DOC 1] NEW DELHI: A fallout of Delhi governments confrontation with the Centre over its powers has been its face-off with the bureaucracy. The year began on a sour note with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal reacting strongly to the mass leave by DANICS and IAS officers on December 31, 2015. The officers were protesting against suspension of two officials of the home department. This earned them a stinging rebuke from Kejriwal -- B-team of BJP. The year ended with the same bitterness. On December 13, the associations of bureaucrats belonging to the AGMUT cadre of IAS and DANICS adopted a resolution to raise their voice against injustices of any kind by the political executive of the Delhi government meted out to the officers of the state government in discharge of their duties. They said they were anguished by the use of offensive language against some senior officers. The resolution was submitted to deputy CM Manish Sisodia, and home minister Rajnath Singh. Sisodia reacted sternly, saying those who did not want to work seek a transfer. The Delhi CM alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""using LG and IAS and DANICS officers as pawns to target the AAP-led state"" government. The resolution had come in the aftermath of a few incidents. Health minister Satyendar Jain had alleged that when the then health secretary, Chandrakar Bharti, was asked to come to LNJP Hospital, he made the excuse of not having a car. Denying the allegation, the officer said he did finally reach the hospital. In November, the chairman and managing director of Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, K R Meena, had sent a letter to Kejriwal, seeking an apology for his behaviour during a meeting. Another confrontation was over the decision of the then LG, Najeeb Jung, to give temporary charge of member-secretary, Delhi Commission for Women, to women and child development secretary Dilraj Kaur. The CM described her appointment as unconstitutional and posted a member-secretary of DCW chairperson Swati Maliwals choice. The then LG did not relent and the stalemate continues.   The climate of fear and suspicion is yet to get dissipated. The work of scaring bureaucrats is taking place at the central level. And those who are getting scared are unable to work, Sisodia told TOI. He said with Services being taken away from them in an unconstitutional manner, they have lost control over the administration. This had followed the August 5, 2016 high court order declaring that LG as administrator was supreme and stressing Services came under his purview. On August 31, the then LG ordered transfers and postings, replacing some of AAP government's trusted men with senior IAS officers. Health secretary Tarun Seem was replaced by Chandraker Bharti and senior IAS officer Ashwani Kumar made PWD secretary in place of non-IAS Sarvagya Srivastava.   Meanwhile, Kejriwal's former principal secretary, Rajendra Kumar, who was suspended in July last year after his arrest by the CBI in a case of alleged corruption, has sought voluntary retirement, alleging victimisation by the Centre and CBI.","The Delhi government's confrontation with the Central government has led to tensions with the Delhi bureaucracy. The year began with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal criticizing officers for taking mass leave, calling them the ""B-team of BJP."" Tensions escalated as bureaucrats raised concerns about ""injustices"" and alleged use of offensive language against them. The conflict intensified after a ruling by the Delhi High Court gave the Lieutenant Governor (LG) supreme authority over Services. The LG subsequently ordered transfers, replacing key members of the AAP government's administration. The Delhi government has alleged that the Prime Minister is targeting the AAP government through the LG and bureaucrats. The atmosphere remains one of fear and suspicion, with bureaucrats allegedly being ""scared"" to work effectively due to interference from the Centre. Former Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar has sought voluntary retirement, alleging victimization by the Centre and CBI."

""The south-west monsoon has reached Kerala,"" IMD Director B P Yadav said.

Monsoon rains are key for cultivation of kharif crops which account for nearly 60 per cent of the farm output of the country. A good kharif season augurs well for a range of goods and services. The weather office had earlier forecast that monsoon would reach Kerala between May 23 and 25. The normal monsoon onset date over Kerala is June 1.

Most parts of the state have been receiving widespread pre-monsoon showers, creating the mood of the arrival of the rainy season, known in local parlance as ""Kalavarsham"".

Yadav said monsoon was expected to advance further in the next few days in Kerala and the northeastern parts of the country.Weather scientists are keeping a close watch on the low pressure area currently lying over east-central Bay of Bengal which is expected to intensify into a cyclone.

In such a case monsoon may play a disappearing act over peninsular India as the cyclone would suck away moisture over the region and weaken the monsoon system.","The south-west monsoon, crucial for kharif crop cultivation, arrived in Kerala a week ahead of its normal date, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Monsoon rains are essential for kharif crops, which constitute nearly 60% of India's agricultural output. A timely and robust monsoon season is favorable for various goods and services.

Although the government claims that there will be windfall gains from demonetisation and GST in the long run, the immediate need is to grease the wheels of growth.

(PTI Photo) New Delhi: Moving with a strong security pitch, the BJP is all set to wade into the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh on Monday. Leading the attack on the Opposition parties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that after the first round of voting in Uttar Pradesh, âtheir dynasts are sleepless and unable to dream anymoreâ. He added that the BJP government has the antidote for rioters and the mafia. The voting on February 14 is for 55 Assembly seats spanning the nine districts of Amroha, Bareilly, Bijnor, Badaun, Moradabad, Rampur, Saharanpur, Sambhal and Shahjahanpur in western Uttar Pradesh. This is traditionally a region where the Samajwadi Party has done well. In the last Assembly election, the SP got 27 seats. It was then in an alliance with Congress. A buoyant Samajwadi chief, Akhilesh Yadav, claimed that the âwipeout of the BJP has already begunâ after the first phase of voting. The SP-RLD combine is hoping that the farmersâ protests against the three repealed farm laws will find resonance in these districts. Four ministers in the Yogi Adityanath Cabinet -- Mahesh Chandra Gupta, Gulab Devi, Suresh Khanna and Baldev Singh Aulakh -- will test their luck this time. Senior SP leader Azam Khan, who is now in jail, is contesting from Rampur. Congress has fielded Nawab Kazim Ali Khan against Azam Khan. Supriya Aaron of the Samajwadi Party from Bareilly Cantonment, Keerat Singh Gurjar from Gangoh and BJPâs Devendra Nagpal from Naugawan seat are in the fray. Muslim voters have a decisive say in 25 seats while Dalit voters hold the key to some 20-odd Assembly seats in this phase. Saharanpur, Moradabad, Sambhal, Bijnor and Rampur are Muslim strongholds while nine constituencies are reserved for the Scheduled Castes. The SP-RLD is banking considerably on the consolidation of Muslim and Dalit votes, embellished with Jat and Yadav votes. The trouble for the alliance maybe if the Muslim vote is split between the Congress, BSP and the new contender, AIMIM, led by Asaduddin Owaisi. Insiders claim that after the anti-CAA protests, the Muslim votes will consolidate behind the strongest Opposition candidates -- that is the SP-RLD alliance. The alliance partners are heavily banking on this. AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is leading the Congress campaign, has released three manifestos of the party in the state catering to all sections of society. Apart from this, she has also undertaken several door-to-door campaigns, roadshows and rallies. However, Congress got a shock when its declared candidate, Ms Supriya Aaron, shifted to the Samajwadi Party in Bareilly. BSP supremo Mayawati has also declared 40 per cent Muslim candidates in this phase as the BSP also wants to have the Muslim vote coming its way, but its lacklustre campaign, compared to that of the BJP and the SP-RLD, may not help it to gather much support. After the second phase on Monday, almost one-fourth of seats in the state -- 113 out of 403 -- will have voted.

Until electronic voting machines were introduced, dacoits had a role to play in booth-capturing

The police know him as Lukke. The locals say he was second in command to Daku Mansingh, the legendary dacoit who was the uncrowned king of Chambal. But meet Lukke and he introduces himself as Lokman Dixit and laments the “absence of ethics” among the present crop of dacoits. Mention politics and he says that all politicians are thieves.


With 82 years and a bloody past behind him, Lukke rues the current dacoit- (read: criminal) politician nexus and blames it on the “quick buck syndrome” among criminals. More than the patronage given by political heavyweights, Lukke sees it as “a problem within” the tribe. He recalls the times when gang-leaders chided them for setting eyes on a woman, or for violating the code of looting only the rich.





Today, no code exists. Women dacoits are in the forefront and kidnapping has replaced looting. Hobnobbing with politicians, rather working at their behest during elections, is something that is beyond Lukke’s comprehension. Or the fact that dacoit Nirbhay Singh’s recent wedding in the forests, apart from being an extravagant affair, was allegedly attended by several politicians","Lokman Dixit, formerly known as Lukke and once the second-in-command to the infamous Chambal dacoit Mansingh, reflects on the decline of ethics among today’s dacoits. He laments that in his time, dacoits adhered to a strict moral code—targeting only the rich and showing restraint in their actions. Now, that code has eroded, with women joining dacoit ranks and kidnapping replacing traditional looting. Dixit is especially disturbed by the growing nexus between criminals and politicians, where dacoits allegedly support political candidates in return for protection or favors. He points to dacoit Nirbhay Singh’s grand wedding, reportedly attended by politicians, as a symbol of this disturbing trend.

Almost all deaf people across the world rely on sign language to communicate with their peers and loved ones, making it their only mode of physical conversation.

Sign language is a way of communication that uses visual-manual modality to convey a message. Sign language, as opposed to common belief, contains the full spectrum of a language, including proper grammar, punctuation, and lexicons.

The International Day of Sign Languages is celebrated every year to raise awareness about the usage of sign language and help those who have impaired hearings to be less conscious of them while expressing their thoughts in sign language.

The first International Day of Sign Languages was celebrated on September 23, 2018, after the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) proposed the observation of such a day to raise awareness about the usage of sign language and the lives of people who have impaired hearings.

The day September 23 was chosen as the International Day of Sign Languages because the World Federation of the Deaf was established on this day, back in 1951. The WFD has since grown to an organization of around 135 national associations of deaf people.

Sign languages are used by people with disabilities across the world. The main significance and purpose of International Day of Sign Languages are to raise awareness about the usage of sign languages. It is also celebrated to recognize the importance of preserving sign languages for those who rely on them for communication.

Sign languages hold a lot of importance to those, who use this as a primary mode of communication. According to WFD, there are over 70 million deaf people in the world, and hence, the usage of sign language should be preserved at all costs.","The International Day of Sign Languages is observed annually to promote awareness and appreciation of sign language as a vital mode of communication for the deaf community worldwide. Initiated by the World Federation of the Deaf, it commemorates the establishment of the WFD on September 23, 1951. Sign language is recognized as a complete language with its own grammar and lexicon, crucial for facilitating effective communication among the deaf. With over 5 percent of the global population requiring rehabilitation for hearing loss, the significance of preserving and promoting sign languages cannot be overstated. The day serves to underscore the importance of sign languages in fostering inclusivity and understanding for individuals with impaired hearing, highlighting the need for continued efforts to ensure their accessibility and recognition."

8d09063f997d11d5ed9b68e7fbe2ea18,"[DOC 1] ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court validated on Wednesday the death sentence awarded to the now deceased former military ruler Pervez Musharraf by a special court in a high treason case.
Musharraf had been booked for high treason in December 2013 in a case moved by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s government.
In December 2019, a special court had found him guilty of treason under Article 6 of Pakistan’s constitution and sentenced him to death. Article 6 holds that a person who “abrogates or subverts or suspends or holds in abeyance” the country’s constitution has committed high treason.In Pakistan’s history, this is the first time that a military chief has been found guilty and sentenced. Musharraf died in exile in Dubai on February 5, 2023.

On January 13, 2020, the Lahore high court had abolished the death penalty and declared illegal all actions taken against Musharraf by the government, including the filing of a high treason case, formation of a special court and its proceedings. The Lahore HC’s verdict was challenged by senior lawyers and the Pakistan Bar Council in the SC days after it was announced. Last November, the SC had fixed a set of appeals against the verdict for hearing.
In its short order, a four-member SC bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa reinstated the death sentence and dismissed the appeals.

The SC also annulled the decision that had declared unconstitutional the special court that had sentenced Musharraf.

According to the SC’s ruling, notices were given to Musharraf’s heirs regarding the court proceedings at both their local and international residential addresses. Advertisements were also published in Urdu and English newspapers, but Musharraf’s heirs did not respond. “We have no option but to retain the death penalty,” the order stated.


The top court observed that there were two questions before it: whether an appeal could be heard after the person has passed away, and if the death penalty is upheld, will Musharraf’s legal heirs be entitled to his benefits.

Speaking to media after the hearing, Musharraf’s counsel, Salman Safdar, said the appeal had been pending in court for four years.


“Musharraf’s appeal was not heard when he was alive. No criminal case can be prosecuted in the absence of the accused,” Safdar said, adding that the ex-dictator had never committed high treason.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, who was convicted of high treason in December 2019. Musharraf, who passed away in Dubai in February 2023, was charged by Nawaz Sharif’s government in 2013 for abrogating the constitution. This conviction marked the first time a military chief in Pakistan had been found guilty of such charges. Although the Lahore High Court annulled the death sentence and related actions in January 2020, the Supreme Court reinstated the sentence, rejecting appeals against the special court’s validity. Notices to Musharraf’s heirs were ignored, compelling the court to retain the penalty. Musharraf's lawyer, Salman Safdar, criticized the process, noting the appeal was unresolved during Musharraf's lifetime."
1be0f6c8aff9eb5b6cc1edbad2de9d9e,"[DOC 1] The US has extended the December 31 deadline for India to sign an information sharing pact with it regarding overseas investments held by people of both countries. The move  gives relief to businesses and individuals sending funds to India from US financial institutions from a 30% withholding tax that Washington intends to charge in the absence of such a pact.

The benefit of the deadline extension (subject to review after a month) will also go to 42 other nations that have, like India, agreed to sign the agreement, but have so far not been able to. Under the pact, India would share with the US IRS details of investments held by American taxpayers in Indian institutions. The US would reciprocate by sharing details of Indians’ investments in US institutions that will help the Income Tax Department fight tax evasion here.

As per US’s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), US taxpayers have to report at the end of the tax year investments in foreign financial accounts, stock, securities, mutual funds, life insurance or annuity schem-es with cash value above $50,000. Any under-reporting will be caught when IRS receives information from treaty partners.

India has a similar provision in the Income Tax Act, which it had invoked in the case of Cyprus, holding it as a non-co-operating jurisdiction. On November 1, 2013, New Delhi had decided to subject all payments from India to that country to a 30% withholding tax for not facilitating effective exchange of tax information.

Subjecting a huge withholding tax liability on outbound payments to another country is a tactics increasingly being deployed by major economies to elicit information on accounts held in that country by own citizens which are not reported to tax authorities at home. “A jurisdiction that is treated as if it had an inter-government agreement (IGA) in effect, but that has not yet signed an IGA, retains such status beyond December 31, 2014, provided the jurisdiction continues to demonstrate a firm resolve to sign the IGA…as soon as possible,” says an announcement on the IRS website.

The current extension would be reviewed on a monthly basis to assess whether the 43 nations including India should continue to be treated as if they have an IGA in effect, the IRS says.

India’s ability to sign the pact with the US recently came under question when the Supreme Court told the government it should not enter into agreements with secrecy clauses that are not in sync with the Constitution. The court’s concern was that secrecy clauses will prevent naming Indians who hold unaccounted wealth abroad once India receives such information from its treaty partners.

The government, however, believes that without agreeing to confidentiality of information with the sole exception of naming accountholders in tax evasion proceedings, no country will part with information of account holders in that country.

When the finance ministry approached the apex court in mid-October to clarify that its observation on confidentiality clauses does not prevent India from signing more tax treaties, the matter was referred to the Special Investigation Team probing black money cases. The SIT did not raise any objection. However, with the extra time, the finance ministry hopes to get a clarification from the apex court itself.","The US has extended the deadline for India to sign an information sharing pact regarding overseas investments to avoid a 30% withholding tax on funds sent from US financial institutions to India. The extension benefits 42 other nations awaiting the agreement. Under the pact, India would share American taxpayers' investment details with the US IRS, reciprocated for Indian investments in US institutions. The move aligns with the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requiring taxpayers to report foreign investments. India invoked similar provisions with Cyprus in 2013, imposing a 30% withholding tax. The extension allows nations like India to be treated as having an inter-government agreement (IGA) in effect, pending signing. However, India's ability to sign was questioned by the Supreme Court due to secrecy clauses conflicting with the Constitution. The Finance Ministry seeks clarification while the Special Investigation Team on black money cases did not object. The extension provides time for legal clarity."

Judaism, Christianity and Islam grew larger than life here. Though all three faiths have the same roots, they have branched out differently and perhaps because of their common foundation, have found all the more necessity to assert themselves uncompromisingly against one another. Jerusalem, the city of peace as translated from Hebrew, is coveted always by zealous forces of these three faiths. It was bounced upon, torn apart and wrested by each as and when their balance of power shifted. And during this period in history the city was erected, felled and raised only to be destroyed yet again.  

Jerusalem signifies Jesus’ struggle while on earth against sinful human interest and to restore love against hatred and peace against conflict. This immortal gospel of Jesus was condemned by the so called powerful. Bible reminds us of the fast changing circumstances in the last days of Jesus life leading to His death on Good Friday. Jesus suffered injustice, falsehood, betrayal, denial, humiliation and even the feeling of being abandoned by God. The judgment on Jesus by the Jews was quick, fast and decisive.

c14f40f62515ad08ea0be7b4b1a34c2e,"[DOC 1]  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said in a TV interview to Network18 that he suffered political damage for his decision to not issue a white paper on the state of the economy when his government took over in May 2014. He said the sluggish private investments was a continuing fallout of the economic conditions that prevailed when he took office two and a half years back but his government has resisted the temptation to take shortcuts, the positive results of which are now evident across several sectors.
In the interview, the PM he spoke on a wide range of issues, from Lutyens' culture, atrocities against Dalits, the Kashmir situation, and the forthcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh.
 Modi said the economic situation in May 2014 was much worse that it seemed on the surface. Modi said he was confronted with a choice of whether to be politically expedient and put the poor state of the economy in the public domain, or keep the interest of the nation uppermost. He said his government had even mulled tabling a white paper on the economic condition in Parliament before the presentation of the first Budget.
""But that would have dragged the economy even lower, markets would have been badly hit, increased hopelessness, affected the market and the world's view of India would have become worse. It would have got very difficult to pull out the economy out of such (a) morass,"" he said. Modi said this was a reason why his government didn't make public the jugglery that was done in previous Budgets (during UPA rule) and the condition of non-performing assets (NPAs).
 The PM said he opted to be silent in national interest even at the cost of political damage. ""It hurt us, we were criticised. It was made to look like it was my fault. All these issues from the past impacted private investment,"" Modi said. The PM said the positive fallout of this has been that he is now being able to address these issues.
The PM said India is currently among the world's fastest growing economies but experts point out that private investment is yet to pick up. He said a reason could be because his government has ""tightened the screws"" on the issue of NPAs in the banking sector. Modi said he held a meeting with bankers and told them that there would be no phone calls (on issuing loans to industrialists). 
 ""Despite that, the pace at which roads are being made, railways is expanding, there’s a six-fold increase in electronic goods manufacturing, these things show we haven't taken shortcuts. And my motto is like what you see on railway platforms - 'shortcuts will cut you short'. We don't want to take any short cuts and the results are showing,"" he said. Modi said that in the years to come it will be a matter of surprise when unbiased people sit down to analyse the choices his government has made on the economic front.
The PM also spoke on the upcoming Assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh. He said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will contest the elections on the issue of development. Modi said the poison of casteism and communal polarization and that of vote bank politics had witnessed a weakening in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. “A large section of the society has moved towards this politics of development. I hope in the days to come the people of UP, for the betterment of their state, will also move towards this politics of development,” he said.
 On atrocities of Dalits, the PM said such incidents had no place in a civilised society. He, however, said that law-and-order was a state subject. He said the number of atrocities on Dalits and incidents of communal violence have come down during the two and a half years of his government when compared to the UPA rule.
“There has been a conspiracy to selectively raise these issues to defame Modi,” he said, adding that the BJP currently has more tribal Members of Parliament and state legislators than any other party. The PM said his espousal of the Dalit cause and celebrating the contribution of Dr B R Ambedkar had made those people nervous who believe the Dalit vote is their fiefdom. “But I am committed to the welfare of Dalits, tribals, women and other deprived sections of the society,” Modi said.
He, however, advised his party leaders to desist from making irresponsible statements in the media for any particular group of people or community. Modi said television crews are in a race for TRPs (Television Rating Points) but leaders need to show maturity in what they say.
","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a recent TV interview, discussed various issues including the state of the economy, upcoming elections, atrocities against Dalits, and communal polarization. He acknowledged political damage for not disclosing the poor economic conditions when he took office but defended his decision, stating it was in the nation's interest. Modi highlighted the government's focus on development and tightening of banking sector regulations.

faces 14 others, state media said Tuesday.
A military coup in February 2021 plunged the Southeast Asian nation into chaos and widespread violence as the military
junta launched a bloody crackdown on dissent.
""Chairman of State Administration Council pardoned Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who was sentenced by the relevant courts
under five cases,"" a state media broadcast said. The broadcast said the 78-year-old Nobel Peace laureate still faces 14 other cases.
Tuesday's announcement was part of an amnesty of more than 7,000 prisoners to mark Buddhist Lent.
The junta announced on Monday it would extend Myanmar's state of emergency by six months, state media said, which
is likely to delay elections promised for August.
Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since 2021, has been sentenced to 33 years in jail for a clutch of charges, including
corruption, possession of illegal walkie-talkies and flouting coronavirus restrictions.
""She couldn't be freed completely, although some sentences against her were pardoned. She still has to face 14 cases.
Only five cases out of 19 were pardoned,"" a legal source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.
Former Myanmar president Win Myint, who was also removed in the 2021 coup, would also be pardoned in two cases,
the broadcast said.
The announcement said 125 foreign prisoners would be released and pardoned An unspecified number of prisoners facing the death penalty also had their sentences reduced to life imprisonment, it
said.
Suu Kyi has only been seen once since she was held after the February 1, 2021, putsch -- in grainy state media photos
from a bare courtroom in the military-built capital Naypyidaw.
There have been concerns about Suu Kyi's health since her detention, including during her trial in a junta court that
required her to attend almost daily hearings.
She was moved from prison to a government building last week, according to an official from her political party In July, Thailand's foreign minister said he had met with Suu Kyi, the first known meeting with a foreign envoy since she
was detained.
A junta spokesman told AFP the meeting had lasted more than an hour but did not give any details about what was
discussed.
Myanmar frequently grants amnesties to thousands of prisoners to commemorate holidays or special Buddhist dates.
The junta released some 23,000 prisoners after the 2021 coup in a move that human rights groups feared at the time
was aimed at freeing up space for military opponents.
More than 24,000 people have been arrested since the military booted Suu Kyi's government from power, according to
a local monitoring group.
Almost 20,000 remain behind bars, according to the latest figures.","In Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi has been pardoned in five criminal cases but still faces 14 others after being detained since the 2021 military coup. The State Administration Council granted an amnesty to over 7,000 prisoners, including Suu Kyi and former president Win Myint. The state of emergency has been extended by six months, likely postponing promised elections. Concerns about Suu Kyi's health persist, and she was moved to a government building from prison. Myanmar has a history of granting amnesties, including releasing 23,000 prisoners after the coup. However, over 24,000 people have been arrested, with nearly 20,000 remaining in detention."

As reported by PTI, General Naravane in his memoir ‘Four Stars of Destiny’ elaborates on the birth of the ‘Agnipath’ recruitment scheme, considered India's most radical military recruitment policy.
Shortly after assuming the role of Army Chief, General MM Naravane discussed the ‘Tour of Duty’ scheme with the prime minister in a meeting in early 2020. Originally proposed for the Army and involving short-term soldier tenures, the scheme's scope was later expanded to encompass all three services when the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) introduced a broader formulation months later, the report said.
General MM Naravane, the 28th Army Chief from December 31, 2019, to April 30, 2022, mentioned that during his tenure, discussions took place regarding different models of the ‘Tour of Duty’ scheme.

Initially, the Army's perspective was that 75 per cent of the recruited personnel could be retained, while the remaining 25 per cent should be released.

In June 2022, the government introduced the Agnipath recruitment scheme, focusing on the short-term enlistment of individuals to lower the age demographic of the three services. The initiative allows for the recruitment of individuals aged between 17.5 and 21 for four years, with the option to retain 25 per cent of them for an additional 15 years.","Former Army Chief General MM Naravane detailed India's significant military recruitment policy, 'Agnipath,' in his memoir 'Four Stars of Destiny.'

The response comes in the wake of a report highlighting concerns about the state’s preparedness to handle the growing influx of tourists, especially in the wake of the tragic death of Raja Raghuvanshi during his reported honeymoon trip last month.
In a statement, the Tourism department pointed out that Meghalaya is home to one of the first regional branches of the Indian Institute of Tourism and Travel Management (IITTM) in the Northeast—an institute of national importance under the Ministry of Tourism. Land has already been allotted for the institute’s permanent campus at Mawkhanu, Mawpdang, in the New Shillong Township.
“The successful facilitation and bringing of the institute to Meghalaya is, in itself, a significant achievement of the State Government, for which the State is thankful to the Government of India,” the statement said, adding that the government is actively following up with the Centre for the establishment of the permanent campus.

Speaking exclusively with Financial Express Online, Johnson said, ?Beer is a kind of drink which every taste bud relishes a different style.

Indian Super League (ISL) side Kerala Blasters on Wednesday appointed Mohun Bagan’s I-League winning coach Kibu Vicuna as their head coach for the upcoming season. This came hours after the franchise announced that it has parted ways with Eelco Schattorie after one season at the helm of affairs.

“We are happy to announce that Kibu Vicuna will take over as head coach for the upcoming season!” Kerala Blasters said in a tweet.

Spain’s Vicuna oversaw Mohun Bagan win the title with four rounds to spare. The league was suspended midway due to the Covid-19 pandemic and later had to be called off with Mohun Bagan declared champions.
Mohun Bagan have merged with ATK to enter the ISL from next season with Antonio Lopez Habas, who coached ATK to their record third title, in charge of the combined outfit.
Dutchman Schattorie was in charge of the Kochi-based outfit in the ISL 2019-20 and could only guide the club to a poor seventh-place finish.

“Kerala Blasters FC have parted ways with the Head Coach, Eelco Schattorie. We’d like to thank Eelco for his efforts and services during his tenure and wish him the best for the future,” Kerala Blasters had tweeted earlier in the day.

The 48-year-old first landed on Indian shores when he took over Kolkata-based Prayag United back in 2012. He went on to win the IFA Shield and guided the team to a fourth-placed finish in the I-League.
After serving as the head coach for Kolkata giants East Bengal for the 2015 season, he joined Avram Grant’s NorthEast United setup for parts of the 2016 ISL season, before taking over as head coach for the 2018-19 campaign.

In his very first season as a head coach in the ISL, Schattorie showcased immense tactical guile and took Guwahati-based NorthEast United to the semi-finals for the first time since the club’s inception, before being knocked out by eventual champions Bengaluru FC.

After leading the NorthEast United to their best-ever campaign in the club’s history, Schattorie replaced Nelo Vingada as the Kerala Blasters head coach heading into ISL 2019-20.

The Dutchman, however, could not replicate the same success in Kerala which he had achieved with the NorthEast United as several factors came into play.
A host of recurring injuries to key players, including a season-long one to stopper Sandesh Jhingan, severely handicapped Kerala’s campaign as they finished seventh on the table with 19 points from 18 matches.
Despite not making the top four, Schattorie’s Kerala side found a lot of admirers for their free-flowing attacking style of football.

Describing the action of the environment ministry as “arbitrary”, Chauhan has said Rs 2,500 crore has been spent on the power project and more than Rs 500 crore on the water supply schemes.

“Action by MoEF at a critical stage of the project implementation is extremely detrimental to planning and development process... this action is anti-development and anti-poor.”
The ministry’s decision is bound to cause some discomfort to Congress in MP with the CM saying, “MoEF has continuously threatened shutting down this project despite the state government’s repeated assurance about the adequate rehabilitation of project-affected families.

The CM pointed to the obstructive nature of the activities of the Narmada Bachao Andolan in preventing relief and rehabilitation work and said a committee appointed by the Centre has itself “brought to light the negative role of the NBA”. Using strong language, the CM said, “The state government is compelled to think that the MoEF is driven by some agenda which leads it to unreasonable and arbitrary actions of which Maheshwar is only one example.”

This is the second time that environment minister Jairam Ramesh has rubbed a state the wrong way. The ministry halted construction of two dams in Uttarakhand prompting chief minister Ramesh Pokhriyal to demand compensation for the loss of power generation.
Chauhan said that the project would cause submergence only after the gates are closed. “There is no need to suspend work as fulfilment of conditions in (environment clearance) can be ensured before closure of gates...I assure you no submergence will be allowed unless resettlement is completed,” he said.
","Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Chauhan has strongly protested to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh against the Environment Ministry’s order halting the Maheshwar dam project. Chauhan claims the stoppage will result in a daily loss of 7.2 lakh units of power and 360 MLD of water for Dewas and Indore. Labeling the ministry's action as “arbitrary,” Chauhan highlighted that Rs 2,500 crore has already been spent on the power project and more than Rs 500 crore on water supply schemes. He criticized the ministry for its detrimental impact on development and accused it of being “anti-development and anti-poor.”

Chauhan also noted the persistent threats by the ministry to shut down the project, despite assurances from the state government regarding adequate rehabilitation of affected families. He blamed the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) for obstructing relief and rehabilitation efforts, citing a central committee report highlighting the NBA's negative role. Chauhan suggested the Environment Ministry is driven by an unreasonable agenda, with Maheshwar being one such example. This incident marks the second time Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh has clashed with a state, following the halting of two dam constructions in Uttarakhand, which led to demands for compensation from Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal."

30a791f8abdf1926b13d9242fbabd23d,"[DOC 1] The 17-year-old BJP-JD(U) marriage is on the rocks over the elevation of Narendra Modi, but the NDA lead party does not appear overly worried. Emboldened by friendly overtures from AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa, the BJP seems prepared to move on with new friends.

The “secular” JD(U), which has made its unease amply clear over the “2002-riots tainted” Modi acquiring centrestage, wants to break-up, but the BJP wants Nitish to make the first move.

NDA working chairman and BJP veteran LK Advani is learnt to have called up Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav on Wednesday in what is being interpreted as a last-ditch effort. He is learnt to have told them that it was important for the parties to contest the Lok Sabha polls together, party sources said.

However, what Nitish seems to be looking for is a categorical statement from the BJP (something even Advani tried for when he resigned from the BJP’s organisational posts on Monday) that Modi will not be the NDA’s Prime Ministerial candidate.

At the same time, an unfazed BJP also appears to be preparing for a life without JD(U). Party spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain maintained that the mandate of the 10.5 crore people of Bihar was not for the JD(U) or the BJP, but the NDA alliance. “How can we insult the faith of the people?” he reasoned.

There is plenty at stake for the two allies, but the BJP is also feeling emboldened after JD(U)’s humiliating Maharajganj defeat. The saffron party is also certain that while the Congress may welcome the JD(U) in its fold, but then it would stand to lose RJD and Lalu Prasad, who is currently holding a bigger sway in the state.

So, while Nitish may get outside support from the Congress to save his present government, when it comes to brass tacks in future, the grand old party may opt for Lalu.

While the JD-U is contemplating splitting from the BJP and even warming up to the idea of a federal front floated by Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, a deceptively calm BJP seems to have decided to let the JD-U do all the talking, at least for the time being.

According to senior BJP leaders, they will wait for the JD-U to make the first move so that Nitish ends up becoming the “bad guy” who broke the alliance and the confidence of the people of Bihar.

Dismissing observations that Modi was the cause of trouble in the NDA backyard, they argue that the Gujarat Chief Minister was very much a part of the BJP even when Nitish decided to go with the saffron fold over 17 years ago. “What is so new, what has changed?” they ask.

The BJP is all set to go solo on all 40 seats, sources said. Today, there were consultations on the latest crisis precipitated by the JD-U, with party president Rajnath Singh instructing all leaders and spokespersons to continue maintaining that the alliance is intact. He said the emphasis would be on the fact that the people’s mandate was for the NDA coalition and not JD-U alone, sources said.

“Nitish has been successful in Bihar because of the alliance with the BJP and he should not repeat the mistake of underestimating us like he did in the case of Maharajganj. He lost the seat badly because the people there rejected his anti-Modi stance and our cadre also did not help his candidate,” sources add.

They say that despite the BJP winning 67 seats as against JD-U’s 47 in 2005, the BJP favoured Nitish as Chief Minister because the fight was against Lalu. “The BJP has always propped up Nitish, even more than its own CMs, including Modi. He appears to have conveniently forgotten this,” a source said.","The BJP-JD(U) alliance faces collapse over Narendra Modi's rise, with JD(U) uneasy about his 2002 riots image. BJP seems ready to part ways, buoyed by alternative alliances and JD(U)’s recent electoral setback. Efforts to reconcile continue, but BJP insists JD(U) must initiate the break to bear public accountability.

Briefing reporters after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and visiting Bhutan king Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, Kwatra said the national interests of both sides are based on trust and sensitivity to each other’s interests.

24569a73bdeb755162b18b1adb55b84d,"[DOC 1] India arrived in South Africa with great expectations of conquering their final frontier. However, Rohit Sharma's men delivered one of their most lackluster performances in recent memory during the Test match. South Africa dominated the game, hammering India by an innings and 32 runs, concluding the Boxing Day Test in a mere three days.

Amidst the disappointment, Virat Kohli displayed his resilience by scoring a determined 76 runs in the third innings. Unfortunately, the rest of the batting unit appeared utterly clueless against a fired-up South African pace attack. Led by the experienced Kagiso Rabada and debutant Nandre Burger, the opposition's bowlers wreaked havoc, with Burger finishing with impressive figures of 4 for 33. India's third innings lasted a mere 34.1 overs, as they crumbled meekly in what can only be described as one of the most feeble batting displays by the Test team in recent times. They managed a paltry 131 runs, while the South African pacers ran riot.

KL Rahul's century in the first innings was undoubtedly a shining moment, but it cannot overshadow the collective failure of the batting unit. Conversely, Dean Elgar, in his penultimate Test, delivered a sensational performance, scoring an impressive 185 runs, while Marco Jansen remained unbeaten with a remarkable 84, enabling South Africa to post a formidable total of 408 in the first innings.

Regrettably, India's bowling attack, which heavily relied on the talents of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, appeared lackluster, with debutant Prasidh Krishna and all-rounder Shardul Thakur conceding a significant number of runs.

Not only did India falter with the bat and ball, but their overall performance on the field was also lackluster. This stark contrast to the team's recent success in the World Cup, under the leadership of Rohit Sharma, was disheartening. In his inaugural Test as captain in South Africa, India suffered one of their most humbling defeats.

It is worth noting that India has never emerged victorious in a Test series in South Africa since their first tour in 1992, and unfortunately, this record will remain unbroken in the ongoing two-match series. Out of the 24 Tests played in the Rainbow Nation, India has managed to secure victory in only four.","India suffered a crushing defeat against South Africa in the opening Test in Centurion, losing by an innings and 32 runs.

This refers to your editorial “Stop Violence in name of Cow Protection” AF- June 30).  Our PM has rightly said that “Nobody has the right and no one can be allowed to kill people in the name of cow protection. There is no place for violence in society. It is unacceptable. This is not something with which Gandhiji would have agreed.” Simple warning by PM is not enough, strictest possible action is required to be taken against such goons.PM Modi has spoken wisely and reassuringly and it is time for mobs, vigilantes, moral police, street fighters, etc. to quit now. Breaking his silence on cow vigilantes in the country, PM Modi has also condemned their actions, saying most of them were anti-social elements masquerading as gau rakshaks (cow protectors).

The self-appointed gau-rakshaks have created a reign of terror in the country. Attacks on Dalits and Muslims in the name of protecting the “holy” cow is totally aunjustifiable. Mahatma Gandhi had never approved violence in the name of cow protection and sharply differed with the Hindu communalists. Unlike them, Gandhi preferred “persuasion” and other non-violent (ahimsa) ways to achieve gau-raksha (cow protection). Gandhi is invoked frequently in the course of the debate but his musings on cows and cow slaughter were nuanced and evolved over time. He asked people to focus on gau ‘seva’ or serving cows and not on protection or gau ‘raksha’.

In 1921, he reflected: “I would not kill a human being for protecting a cow, as I will not kill a cow for saving a human life, be it ever so precious.”

By 1946, Gandhi was clear that, “Cow slaughter can never be stopped by law. Knowledge, education, and the spirit of kindliness towards her alone can put an end to it.”

PM Modi should ensure that  the cowards  doing such type of bloodiness activities should  be strictly punished under the Law in a fast track Mode so that other schizophrenic may get lesson and we can save the life of innocent people.

Yours,

Vinod C. Dixit

Ahmedabad","The letter to the editor expresses concern about the rising violence in the name of cow protection in India. The author cites Prime Minister Modi's statement condemning such actions and emphasizes the need for strict and immediate action against those involved. The letter draws attention to Mahatma Gandhi's approach to cow protection, advocating for non-violent methods. The author urges the government to ensure swift legal action against individuals engaging in violent activities, emphasizing the importance of protecting innocent lives."

Tuesday has widely been dubbed “V Day,” reflecting the hope of victory over the coronavirus disease that has killed at least 1.5 million people across the globe and upended the lives of millions more.

The day also marked the fastest development, delivery and administration of vaccines in history: from concept to design to clinical trials and regulatory approval, within 10 months.

Queen Elizabeth, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are also expected to soon receive the two-dose vaccine, which is being delivered 21 days apart. The first priority group of over 80-year-olds and healthcare workers were given the vaccines in 50 hospitals across the UK.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the day as a “historic moment”, but urged Britons to continue following social distancing, washing hands and wearing masks.

An upbeat health secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons: “This simple act of vaccination is a tribute to scientific endeavour, to human ingenuity, and to the hard work of so many people. Today marks the start of the fightback against our common enemy, coronavirus, and while today is a day to celebrate there is much work to be done.”

The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine and is expected to receive 4 million more by the end of this month. The UK regulator is also evaluating the clinical data of the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccine candidates.

Keenan, who received the vaccine in Coventry, said she felt “so privileged” to be the first to receive it, while the Shukla couple received it in Newcastle. Hari Shukla, 87, a leading race relations campaigner, said it was his “duty” to have the vaccine.
The second person in UK to receive the vaccine – William Shakespeare, 81 – also hit the headlines. He and Keenan received it in the University Hospital in Coventry in the Midlands, not far from Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of the better-known Bard of Avon.

The modern-day Shakespeare’s name sparked much ado and creativity on the social media, evidence that there is a lot in a name. The image of him receiving the vaccine was widely shared, with remarks such as: ‘The Taming of the Flu’ and ‘The Two Gentlemen of Corona’.

One commentator wondered if Keenan were to be called Patient 1A, would Shakespeare be “Patient 2B or not 2B?” Another said he was “glad he (Shakespeare) wasn’t Bard from having it”, and some hoped that “In a world when people hardly ever remember who came second, the second person to get the Covid jab might stick in the memory”.

Hancock also had a laugh on live television that the second person to receive the vaccine was named William Shakespeare, insisting the vaccine rollout “makes you so proud to be British”.

Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive, said: “The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic. NHS vaccination programmes which have successfully helped overcome tuberculosis, polio and smallpox now turn their focus to coronavirus.”

As of Monday evening, 61,434 people, including 1,061 people of Indian origin, had died in UK hospitals and care-homes, making it the worst affected country in Europe. The number of cases has climbed to over 1.7 million.","Margaret Keenan, 90, made history by becoming the first person in the UK to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday.

The day marked the beginning of the UK's largest-ever vaccination program, with thousands more receiving the vaccine, including British-Indian couple Hari and Ranjan Shukla.

The event, dubbed ""V Day,"" symbolizes hope for victory over the pandemic, which has claimed millions of lives worldwide. It also represents a remarkable achievement in vaccine development, with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine going from concept to administration within 10 months.

Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip are expected to receive the vaccine soon, along with other priority groups such as healthcare workers and those over 80 years old. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the day as a historic moment but emphasized the importance of continuing preventive measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing.

The UK has ordered millions of vaccine doses and is evaluating additional candidates, including those from the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna. The deployment of the vaccine marks a significant milestone in the fight against the pandemic, according to NHS England's chief executive, Simon Stevens.

While the UK celebrates this milestone, the country continues to battle the virus, with thousands of deaths and millions of cases reported. However, the vaccination program offers hope for a brighter future and a decisive turning point in the fight against Covid-19."
ca10af8516853ce133b8c1a8c1d6e253,"[DOC 1] Blanchard was granted parole after serving 85% of her original sentence
Gypsy Rose Blanchard, the Missouri woman who persuaded an online boyfriend to kill her mother after she had forced her to pretend for years that she was suffering from leukemia, muscular dystrophy and other serious illnesses, was released Thursday from prison on parole.

Blanchard was released early in the day from the Chillicothe Correctional Center, said Karen Pojmann, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Corrections. Blanchard was granted parole after serving 85% of her original sentence, Pojmann said.

Blanchard's case sparked national tabloid interest after reports emerged that her mother, Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, who was slain in 2015, had essentially kept her daughter prisoner, forcing her to use a wheelchair and feeding tube.

It turned out that Gypsy Blanchard, now 32, was perfectly healthy, not developmentally delayed as her friends had always believed. Her mother had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological disorder in which parents or caregivers seek sympathy through the exaggerated or made-up illnesses of their children, said her trial attorney, Michael Stanfield.

“People were constantly telling Dee Dee what a wonderful mother she was, and Dee Dee was getting all of this attention,” he said.

Through the ruse, the mother and daughter met country star Miranda Lambert and received charitable donations, a trip to Disney World and even a home near Springfield from Habitat for Humanity.

Stanfield said Gypsy Blanchard's mother was able to dupe doctors by telling them her daughter's medical records had been lost in Hurricane Katrina. If they asked too many questions, she just found a new physician, shaving the girl's head to back up her story. Among the unnecessary procedures Gypsy Blanchard underwent was the removal of her salivary glands. Her mother convinced doctors it was necessary by using topical anesthetic to cause drooling.


Gypsy Blanchard, who had little schooling or contact with anyone but her mother, also was misled, especially when she was younger, Stanfield said.

“The doctors seem to confirm everything that you’re being told. The outside world is telling you that your mother is a wonderful, loving, caring person. What other idea can you have?” Stanfield said.

But then the abuse became more physical, Stanfield said. Gypsy testified that her mother beat her and chained her to a bed. Slowly, Gypsy also was beginning to understand that she wasn’t as sick as her mom said.

“I wanted to be free of her hold on me,” Gypsy testified at the 2018 trial of her former boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn of Big Bend, Wisconsin, who is serving a life sentence in the killing. She went on to add: “I talked him into it.”

When she took the stand at his trial, prosecutors already had cut her a deal because of the abuse she had endured. In exchange for pleading guilty in 2016 to second-degree murder, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The first-degree murder charge she initially faced would have meant a life term.

“Nick was so in love with her and so obsessed with her that he would do anything,” Godejohn’s trial attorney Dewayne Perry argued in court, saying his client has autism and was manipulated.

Prosecutors, however, argued that he was motivated by sex and a desire to be with Gypsy Blanchard, whom he met on a Christian dating website.

According to the probable cause statement, Gypsy Blanchard supplied the knife and hid in a bathroom while Godejohn repeatedly stabbed her mother. The two ultimately made their way by bus to Wisconsin, where they were arrested.


“Things are not always as they appear,” said Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott as the strange revelations began to emerge.

Even Gypsy's age was a lie. Her mother had said she was younger to make it easier to perpetuate the fraud, and got away with it because Gypsy was so small: just 4 feet, 11 inches (150 centimeters) tall.

Law enforcement was initially so confused that the original court documents listed three different ages for her, with the youngest being 19. She was 23.

Greene County Prosecutor Dan Patterson described it as “one of the most extraordinary and unusual cases we have seen.”

Stanfield recalled that the first time he met Gypsy, she got out of breath walking the 75 yards (69 meters) from the elevator to the room where he talked to her. He described her as malnourished and physically frail.


“I can honestly say I’ve rarely had a client who looks exceedingly better after doing a fairly long prison sentence,"" Stanfield said. ""Prison is generally not a place where you become happy and healthy. And I say that because, to me, that’s kind of the evidence to the rest of the world as to just how bad what Gypsy was going through really was.”

Gypsy Blanchard later said it wasn’t until her arrest that she realized how healthy she was. But it took time. Eventually, she got married while behind bars to Ryan Scott Anderson, now 37, of Saint Charles, Louisiana.

The bizarre case was the subject of the 2017 HBO documentary “Mommy Dead and Dearest,” the 2019 Hulu miniseries “The Act"" and an upcoming Lifetime docuseries “The Prison Confession of Gypsy Rose Blanchard.” Daytime television psychologist “Dr. Phil” McGraw interviewed her from prison. The novel “Darling Rose Gold"" draws upon the story for its premise and Blanchard's own account, “Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom” is set for publication next month.


Amid the media storm, Pojmann, of the corrections department, said no in-person coverage of her release was allowed “in the interest of protecting safety, security and privacy.”","Gypsy Rose Blanchard, a Missouri woman who persuaded an online boyfriend to kill her mother after she forced her to pretend she was suffering from leukemia, muscular dystrophy, and other serious illnesses, was released on parole after serving 85% of her original sentence.

However, in neighbouring Haryana, while the number of fatalities was higher than in Punjab, road accidents caused more injuries than deaths, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data showed.

Road accidents have generally caused more injuries than deaths. However, in a few states such as Punjab, these have led to a higher number of fatalities than injuries, the data shows.

In Punjab in 2022, 6,122 road accidents caused 4,688 deaths and 3,372 injuries. The previous year, 6,097 road accidents caused 4,516 deaths and 3,034 injuries. In Haryana, 10,049 road accidents were reported in 2021. The figure rose marginally to 10,654 in 2022.

In 2021, 4,983 people died in Haryana while the figure for 2022 was at 5,228. The accidents caused injuries to 7,972 and 8,353 people, respectively, in the two years.

According to the report, accidents are indicators of bottlenecks and other hindrances to the smooth flow of traffic. As a result, the NCRB collects detailed data on traffic accidents, including road accidents, to infer the trends and patterns of traffic accidents for planners to devise appropriate preventive strategies.

According to the NCRB data, 660 people died and 1,398 were injured in road accidents involving light motor vehicles such as SUVs and cars in 2022 in Haryana.

The corresponding figures for the same year in Punjab were 1,101 deaths and 861 injuries. Additionally, in both states, injuries and fatalities caused by two-wheeler riders were quite high.

In 2022, 2,182 two-wheeler riders were killed and 3,420 injured in Haryana while 2,099 died and 1,663 were injured in Punjab. As many as 215 cyclists died in road accidents and 112 were injured in Punjab in 2022 against 114 deaths and 120 injuries in Haryana.

In 2022, 1,164 pedestrians died in Haryana and 1,663 were injured against 609 deaths and 241 injuries in Punjab. The Punjab government is raising a specialised force to streamline traffic movement and check road accidents.

To be raised as a part of the Punjab Police, the Sadak Surakhya Force (Road Safety Force) personnel will be deployed at national and state highways where the majority of road accidents occur every year, officials said.

Haryana is also embarking on a series of transformative projects aimed at saving lives on its roads, Chief Secretary Sanjeev Kaushal recently said.

A fleet of 670 ambulances has been integrated with the '112' emergency helpline to provide timely medical assistance to road accident victims.

Recently, The Centre of Excellence for Road Safety -- a central government organisation -- in collaboration with IIT-Madras, planned to launch a special project in Haryana to bring together the best practices in road safety, develop systems and provide data-driven advice to all stakeholders and the public.","In Punjab, road accidents in 2021 and 2022 resulted in more deaths than injuries, contrasting with neighbouring Haryana where injuries outnumbered fatalities. Punjab reported 6,122 accidents in 2022, causing 4,688 deaths and 3,372 injuries. Haryana saw 10,049 accidents in 2021 and 10,654 in 2022, resulting in 4,983 and 5,228 deaths respectively. Both states witnessed high casualties among two-wheeler riders and pedestrians. Punjab plans to establish a specialized force, the Sadak Surakhya Force, to address road safety, while Haryana implements initiatives including integrating ambulances with emergency services and collaborating on road safety projects with national organizations like IIT-Madras."
0e6a04b654f3fc6bf72d816cf8e3d089,"[DOC 1] While the insurgents are attacking the security installations in Jammu and Kashmir, relations between the armed forces and the civilian authorities have been marred due to a persisting problem relating to ‘rank’.

The Army top brass has taken up the issue with the Ministry of Defence (MoD), but its proposals have evoked little response. The Army top brass has been peeved at the attitude of the MoD, which, they say, was having a negative effect on the morale of this fighting arm of the armed forces.

The problem relates to the functional differences between officers of the rank of Director General of Police (DGP), both the Jammu and Kashmir state police force and the central police organisations (CPOs), stationed in the troubled state and the Army officers of the rank of Lt.Gen who are either posted as Corp Commanders or as the GOCs. The officers holding these ranks are presently considered to hold the same status.

The Army Headquarters (AHQ) has suggested that for the smoother functional coordination, the Lt Gen should be deemed a rank higher than the DGPs. This especially keeping in view the proposal to have a unified command in the future. However, the civilian authorities in the MoD are not amused. This is not the only point of difference between the AHQ and the MoD. The Army top brass is also said to be upset with the MoD for not willing to grant parity in salaries to the non-commissioned officers in the force with the civilian officials of the same rank in the ministry.

Sources said that the Chief of the Army Staff, Gen V.P. Malik, was particularly not happy with the proposals being put on hold as they were directly affecting the working of the force and lack of coordination between the Army and the civilian authorities in Jammu and Kashmir was leading to a large number of casualties.

The two proposals from the Army are apparently part of the larger proposal made to the ‘high-powered committee’ under the Cabinet Secretary, which is going through the Ajit Kumar Committee report on the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission. The Ajit Kumar Committee was set up specially to go into the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission after there were a number of protests from the officers of the armed forces.

Although the Ajit Kumar panel presented its report in April 1998, yet it was referred to another high- powered committee under the Cabinet Secretary in which the three Chiefs of Staff had also been associated. While the two contentious issues have come up for discussion time and again during meetings of this high-powered committee, but there has not been much action.

The sources said these two particular proposals of the Army were also sent to the Union Cabinet, but were turned down. The matter has now been referred to the group of ministers (GoM), which consists of the Defence Minister, the Finance Minister and also the Home Minister.

Senior Army officials were of the view that if these two contentious issues were not tackled at the earliest it could have a major effect on the morale of the officers. They were of the view that the government should take a decision on the two issues at the earliest.","The Army top brass in Jammu and Kashmir have raised concerns about the rank of officers in the armed forces, a matter that has been causing tensions with civilian authorities. The Army Headquarters (AHQ) has proposed that Lt Gens should be deemed higher than DGPs for better coordination, but this has not been well-received by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Army is also unhappy with the MoD's refusal to grant parity in salaries for non-commissioned officers with civilian officials of the same rank in the ministry. The proposals are part of a larger proposal to a high-powered committee under the Cabinet Secretary, which is reviewing the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission. The matter has been referred to the group of ministers, including the Defence Minister, Finance Minister, and Home Minister.

While all markets, offices, industries and businesses will be allowed to open, inter-state and intra-state movement of â€œpassenger vehicles and busesâ€ will be permitted with the consent of the states involved. Significantly, in its guidelines for Phase IV of the lockdown beginning Monday, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the â€œdelineation of red, green and orange zones will be decided by the state and UT governments after taking into consideration the parameters shared by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.â€ The district authorities have been told to demarcate â€œcontainmentâ€ and â€œbufferâ€ areas within red and orange zones as per the Health Ministryâ€™s guidelines. While the Centre was taking these decisions till now, many state governments had objected to an entire district being listed as a red or orange zone or an entire municipal area being demarcated as a hotspot. They had said this restricted their elbow room to kickstart the economy, especially in entirely urban areas like Delhi. Read | Now, states get a greater sayâ€”and ownership Under the new guidelines, â€œthe zones can be a district, or a municipal corporation/ municipality or even smaller administrative units such as sub-divisions, etc, as decided by states and UTs,â€ an MHA statement said. The decision to allow inter-state travel - including buses - will greatly ease public transportation, providing relief to migrant labourers on the roads. The restrictions on air travel (domestic and international) and Metro rail services will continue, and schools, colleges and other educational institutes will remain closed. All social, political and religious functions and gatherings will still be barred, and places of worship will remain shut. Also Read | Health outlines parameters for states to map out zones While hotels, cinema halls, malls, swimming pools, gyms will continue to be closed, restaurants will be â€œpermitted to operate kitchens for home deliveryâ€ and â€œtakeawayâ€ only. â€œSports complexes and stadia will be permitted to open; however, spectators will not be allowed,â€ the MHA said. â€œAll other activities will be permitted, except those which are specifically prohibited,â€ it said. So all services, including those of barber shops, salons and spas, are likely to open. E-commerce delivery of non-essential items, which were earlier prohibited in red zones, have now been permitted. Cycle-rickshaws, auto- rickshaws and taxis will also be allowed. The restrictions on the number of passengers in a car or on a bike in red and orange zones have also been lifted. Even for buses, while social distancing has been advised, the seating capacity cap of 50% has been removed. Read |Â From today, Indiaâ€™s Covid-19 response will shift to states However, movement of people will remain â€œstrictly prohibitedâ€ across the country from 7 pm to 7 am, except for essential activities. On the industrial side, all restrictions on factories and units across the country irrespective of zones (barring containment zones) have been removed. With public transport being allowed, construction companies are no longer required to use in-situ labour. The clause on limiting attendance in private offices to 33% has also been removed. While offices can operate with 100% attendance if they want, the government has advised them to allow â€œwork from homeâ€ as much as possible. In the containment zones, only essential activities will be allowed. â€œThere shall be strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining supply of essential goods and services,â€ the MHA said. There shall be intensive contact tracing, house-to-house surveillance, and other clinical interventions, as required in these areas, it added. The government reiterated that those above 65 years of age, pregnant women, people with co-morbidities, and children below 10 years should stay at home. In the last lockdown guidelines, there were considerable restrictions in red zones, including a ban on plying of buses even within the zone as well as opening of market complexes and services which involve close contact with customers. Now, with markets opening in red zones, liquor shops in these areas are also allowed to open, giving the much needed revenue fillip to states. Earlier, such shops in red zones were allowed to open only if they were standalone outlets. However, the government specified that â€œstates and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may prohibit certain other activities in the various zones, or impose such restrictions as deemed necessary.â€ But they â€œshall not dilute these guidelinesâ€. While in its last guidelines, the Centre had made use of Aarogya Setu app mandatory for employees in an office and put the onus of implementation on employers, the new guidelines have asked them to make â€œbest effortsâ€ in that direction. It also exempted people who do not have smart phones. The mandatory use of the app in containment zones has also been removed. In the backdrop of some districts, like Noida in Uttar Pradesh, making the app mandatory, the MHA said that â€œdistrict authorities may advise individuals to install the Aarogya Setu application on compatible mobile phones and regularly update their health status on the app. This will facilitate timely provision of medical attention to those individuals who are at risk.â€ Taking cognizance of restrictions on movement of doctors and paramedics in some states like Haryana and UP, it specified that â€œall states/ UTs shall allow inter-state and intra-state movement of medical professionals, nurses and paramedical staff, sanitation persons and ambulances, without any restriction. All states/ UTs shall allow inter-state movement of all types of trucks including empty trucks.â€ The MHA said that all its previous standard operating procedures issued in the context of migrant workers and movement of trains will remain in force. â€œIn order to facilitate the movement of persons, various modes of transport have already been opened up. Movement of individuals by trains has been permitted earlier by MHA through an order dated 11.5.2020. Further, evacuation of foreign nationals from India, return of stranded Indian nationals from abroad, sign-on and sign-off of Indian seafarers, and intra-state and inter-state movement of stranded persons by bus and train, will continue to be allowed,â€ it said. It underlined that the protocol on social distancing and hygiene must be followed. â€œLocal authorities should ensure that shops and markets open with staggered timings, so as to ensure social distancing. All shops shall also have to ensure six-feet distance among customers and not allow more than five persons at one time,â€ it said. Wearing of masks shall remain compulsory while spitting will be punishable. Workplaces must be sanitised regularly and have provisions for thermal scanning and sanitisers. The MHAâ€™s guidelines followed the National Disaster Management Authorityâ€™s (NDMA) order directing all departments to â€œcontinue the lockdown measures upto 31st May, 2020.â€ It also directed the NEC (National Executive Committee) to â€œissue modifications in the guidelines as necessary, keeping in view the need to open up economic activities while containing the spread of Covid-19â€. The NEC, headed by Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, is entrusted with issuing guidelines and orders for Covid-19 containment under the Disaster Management Act. Meanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba held a video conference with chief secretaries of all states in the evening. Gauba requested all state officials to cooperate in running more Shramik Special trains for migrant workers, sources said. The Railway Board chairman, who also attended the meeting, assured that more special trains can be started if the states provide quick clearances, sources added. Ownership of response with states After steering the first three phases, the government has decentralised the fourth step by asking states to take charge of the lockdown. It also means that states will have more ownership of the Covid-19 response.","Under the new guidelines, â€œthe zones can be a district, or a municipal corporation/ municipality or even smaller administrative units such as sub-divisions, etc, as decided by states and UTs,â€ an MHA statement said."

7789682f0868a242df18daa5d4d199ce,"[DOC 1] Shahid Kapoor has finally revealed the name of his newborn son. The actor and his wife Mira Rajput have named their baby boy, Zain Kapoor.

Shahid made the reveal through a tweet on Friday. “Zain Kapoor is here and we feel complete. Thank you for all the wishes and blessings. We are overjoyed and so grateful. Love to all,” he wrote in his tweet. Shahid also thanked their doctor for helping them in this important time of their life.

Mira gave birth to Zain on Wednesday night at Mumbai’s Hinduja Hospital. She was visited by her daughter Misha, Shahid’s brother Ishaan Khatter, mother Neelima Azim and father Pankaj Kapoor with his wife Supriya Pathak.

In a news report to Republic TV, Pankaj said: “I am very delighted that a new bundle of joy has come to our house. A baby being born in any house is a matter of sheer joy and excitement. Similarly, it is a moment of joy for our family and as the grandfather of the newborn, I am delighted and very proud of my family. I wish Shahid and Mira all the very best and many congratulations.” In another interview to Mumbai Mirror, Pankaj said, “It’s the most delightful thing that can happen to any family. Shahid’s family is now complete. God bless all of them. We are thrilled about the new arrival.”

Shahid and Mira are one of the most popular couples in Bollywood. Their pictures together as a family are a huge hit online. In an interview with Mid-Day before the birth of his baby boy, the actor spoke about becoming a parent for the second time. He said, “It’s completely different this time. I think we are calmer and more relaxed.” He added, “Mira and I would be asking questions and having doubts. But this time around, we feel like veterans. We have done it once, so we can handle it this time around.”

He also spoke on whether Misha understands what it means to have a younger sibling and said, “With a two-year-old, you can’t tell them too much and at the same time, you can’t surprise them completely. So we make subtle mentions because kids are really absorbent. They learn from looking at things around. She is aware of the change without us having had a conversation with her.”

Shahid’s mother Neelima Azim also revealed that they are still thinking of a name for the baby. “My dearest elder son’s family is now complete... Misha (Shahid and Mira’s two-year-old daughter) has got a brother and Ishaan (son of Neelima Azim and Rajesh Khattar) has got a nephew now. I’m a hands-on grandmother with Misha and since I’ve had two boys of my own, being with the new member of the family will come naturally to me,” she told Mumbai Mirror.

Shahid will soon be seen in Batti Gul Meter Chalu and will begin work on his new film, a remake of Telugu hit Arjun Reddy. He will also be seen in a biopic on Asian gold medallist boxer Dingko Singh.","Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput have named their newborn son Zain Kapoor.

While some have the photographs of Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka on their visiting cards, others have chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy.
""There is a great demand for visiting cards with a combination picture of Rajiv-Sonia, Rajiv-Rahul and Sonia-Priyanka.Most of the buyers who insist for a card with Priyanka's pictures are youth Congress leaders from the districts.
It is a big hit among them. I have sold more than 5,000 visiting cards in January,"" says Vishal Goel, a stationery vendor at Gandhi Bhavan.Another vendor A Jagan agreed, ""The fastest moving visiting cards at my counter are that of chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy. I have sold more than 6,000 of these cards to Congress leaders from the districts, mainly during the plenary.
The next in demand of course are those with Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi. More than 5,000 of them were sold during the plenary and most of the buyers were from Maharashtra and Karnataka.""
When asked about the new trend, senior Congress leader P Sudhakar Reddy said, ""This culture of using photographs has come from Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. Such visiting cards show the emotional attachment of the worker to the leadership.
It is also a medium to remind others about the sacrifices of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi."" Even PCC office-bearers, youth Congress leaders and members of the Priyanka-Rahul Brigade have been found using such visiting cards.
PCC minority cell general secretary K S Bahauddin said, ""I am a hardcore Congressman and I am using a visiting card with Sonia Gandhi's photograph on it for the past 30 months.
I have been greatly touched by her gesture of sacrificing power."" Priyanka-Rahul Brigade president Manoj Alexander said, ""This is a way to express our loyalty to our leaders.""

","In Hyderabad, Congress workers are increasingly adopting the trend of including photographs of party leaders on their visiting cards, seen as a symbol of loyalty. Cards feature images of leaders like Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, and Chief Minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy.

A division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade was hearing a petition filed by Air India pilot Deven Kanani, who claimed the airline was not keeping the middle seats vacant in flights bringing back stranded people to India. Counsels of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) pointed out to the court minutes of the meeting held on May 26, 2020 by the expert committee under the chairmanship of the civil aviation secretary, by which it reviewed and strengthened public health related protocols of air travel. As per the minutes of the meeting, physical distance between two persons helps in minimising transmission through an inadvertent touch, and if persons sitting next to each other could be provided a protective suit which could help in preventing spread of virus either by droplets or by touch. ""We seek clarification from the expert committee as to whether by mere touch of a person carrying COVID-19 virus, it can be transmitted to the person so touched, the court asked and posted the matter for further hearing on Friday. On Thursday, other air carriers like Spicejet, GoAir and IndiGo also filed applications seeking to intervene in the matter, and sought the court to hear their contentions also. The court said it would hear all of them on Friday. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the DGCA, on the last hearing on Tuesday told the court that DGCA issued a circular on May 31, asking air carriers to try to keep the middle seats on flights vacant and provide wraparound gowns to passengers who are allotted such seats. Kanani in his plea claimed the Air India was violating the guidelines laid down in a circular dated March 23 by the Centre, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during air travel. The Air India, however, had opposed the plea, and informed the court last week that the March 23 circular was superseded with a new circular issued by the government on May 22, while permitting domestic flights to operate from May 25. As per the airline, the new circular does not say the middle seat needs to be kept empty. The high court last week noted that a cursory glance at the May 22 circular showed it applied only to domestic flights and not the 'Vande Bharat' international flights operated by Air India. The court had then directed Air India and DGCA to clarify their stand. The Air India later approached the Supreme Court which, while allowing the national carrier to keep operating its scheduled flights with middle seats filled till June 5, observed that the government should be more worried about the health of citizens than the health of commercial airlines.","A division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade was hearing a petition filed by Air India pilot Deven Kanani, who claimed the airline was not keeping the middle seats vacant in flights bringing back stranded people to India."

Maxwell, who was one of three players rushed out to join the tour before the final Test in Johannesburg after the trio were sent home, said it had been extremely hard for the young squad to witness what happened to their teammates.

It was particularly tough for them to watch the televised emotional apologies from Smith and Bancroft on arrival in Australia, and chaotic scenes when Smith was booed and called a cheat while being escorted through Johannesburg airport.

""I think the way they saw it, it was obviously beaten up a fair bit and they've seen a couple of their mates treated like criminals,"" he told Melbourne's Radio SEN today.

""That is a hard thing for you to watch as a teammate, and to what they went through, especially Steve Smith at the airport, that was a hard thing for everyone to watch.

""To then try and get yourself ready for a game of cricket a day later was extremely difficult, and I certainly didn't envy their position at all. It was an extremely tough time for that whole playing group."" The fallout had a big effect on the team as they slumped to a 492-run defeat in the final Test.

All-rounder Maxwell arrived along with opening batsmen Matt Renshaw and Joe Burns as the replacements and he thought he might be able to provide some energy and be a positive influence around the team.

But he admitted it had been harder than he imagined.

5785447c7867b4f834f57fff3da6fc7d,"[DOC 1] India's population is estimated to have reached 1.44 billion, with 24 per cent in the 0-14 age bracket, according to a recent report by the UNFPA.
The United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) State of World Population - 2024 report -- ""Interwoven Lives, Threads of Hope: Ending Inequalities in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights"" -- revealed that India's population is estimated to double in 77 years.
India leads globally with an estimated population of 1.44 billion, followed by China at 1.425 billion, according to the report.
India's population was recorded at 1.21 billion during the last census, conducted in 2011.
The report further detailed that an estimated 24 per cent of India's population is aged 0-14 while 17 per cent is within the 10-19 age range.
The segment aged 10-24 is estimated to constitute 26 per cent, with the 15-64 age group making up 68 per cent. Additionally, 7 per cent of India's population is aged 65 years and above, with men having a life expectancy of 71 years and women 74 years.
The report has found that 30 years of progress in sexual and reproductive health has mostly ignored the most marginalised communities worldwide.
According to the report, the child marriage percentage in India was at 23 between 2006-2023.
The report noted that maternal deaths in India have fallen considerably, accounting for 8 per cent of all such fatalities worldwide.
""India's success is often attributed to improved access to affordable, quality maternal health services as well as efforts to address the impact of gender discrimination on health outcomes,"" the report said.
However, the report noted that India continues to see dramatic inequities in maternal death risk.
Quoting a report on ""Estimates and Correlates of District-Level Maternal Mortality Ratio in India"" by PLOS Global Public Health, the UNFPA said recent research into India's 640 districts revealed that while nearly a third achieved the sustainable development goal of reducing maternal mortality ratio below 70 per 100,000 live births, 114 districts still have ratios of 210 or more.

While disaggregating these figures by socioeconomic group, ethnicity, caste or religion is challenging, these factors clearly play a role in health outcomes,"" it said.
The report noted that women with disabilities are up to 10 times more likely to experience gender-based violence than their peers without disabilities.
Improvements in healthcare access have primarily benefited wealthier women and those who belong to ethnic groups that already had better access to health care.
""Women and girls with disabilities, migrants and refugees, ethnic minorities, LGBTQIA+ people, people living with HIV and disadvantaged castes all face greater sexual and reproductive health risks and also unequal access to sexual and reproductive health care,"" the report said.
Their vulnerability is further compounded by powerful forces such as climate change, humanitarian crises and mass migration, which often have a disproportionate impact on women at the margins of society, it said.
In India, the report said, Dalit activists have argued for legal protection for women facing caste-based discrimination in workplaces and education.
""Many will otherwise remain too poor to support their families and give their children a dignified life, contributing to a cycle that perpetuates poor sexual and reproductive health. Almost half of Dalit women, for instance, receive no antenatal care, and high rates of gender-based violence are considered a means of oppression and control,"" it said.
The report said millions of women and girls remain far behind, and progress is slowing or stalled on key measures -- 800 women die every day giving birth, unchanged since 2016; a quarter of women cannot say no to sex with their partner and nearly one in 10 women cannot make their own decisions about contraception.
In 40 per cent of countries with data, the report said women's bodily autonomy is diminishing.
""In the space of a generation, we have reduced the unintended pregnancy rate by nearly one-fifth, lowered the maternal death rate by one-third, and secured laws against domestic violence in more than 160 countries,"" said UNFPA Executive Director Dr Natalia Kanem.

Karunanidhi's interaction with Gandhi put to rest uncertainty regarding the alliance since the exit of disgraced former telecom minister A Raja over the 2G spectrum scam.
It was the DMK chief's first meeting with Gandhi since Raja quit in November following a damning CAG report on the allocation of air waves.

""I met Sonia Gandhi for 45 minutes. As a result, the DMK-Congress coalition is continuing,"" he told reporters.

The Congress and DMK had entered into an alliance in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. Later, they fought the 2006 Assembly elections and the 2009 general elections together.

Ironically, Karunanidhi's talks with the Congress chief came on a day the CBI grilled Raja for the third time and the Justice Shivraj Patil panel indicted him for showing favours to some telecom companies in granting 2G spectrum between October 2007 and 2008.

Before seeing Gandhi, the CM called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh whose January 3 remark about the alliance had set the ball rolling.

Clearly showing the Raja episode was behind them, Karunanidhi and Gandhi agreed on setting up a joint panel, which would work out the ""modalities"" of the seat sharing arrangement.

Karunanidhi was assisted in the talks by DMK parliamentary party leader TR Baalu, textiles minister Dayanidhi Maran and Rajya Sabh MP and daughter Kanimozhi.

Sources said the Congress has pitched for not less than 75 of the 234 assembly seats. The DMK, however, wants to restrict the number to 60 to 65 seats.

With the DMK seeking to restrict the number of seats

to be contested by allies, both sides are likely to be engaged in hard bargain. A formal announcement about the panel for this purpose would be made in a day or two.

Summary: The death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala’s Silent Valley National Park has highlighted the ongoing man-animal conflict in the state. Despite various measures like elephant-proof trenches and electric fences, conflicts with wild elephants, boars, and monkeys persist. The 2019 state economic review reported an increase in such incidents, with 7,890 cases in 2018-19 compared to 7,229 in 2017-18. Between 2015 and 2020, 416 elephants died, with 24 from unnatural causes, and 514 people were killed by wild animals. Efforts to manage these conflicts, including culling orders and habitat protection, have been challenging due to fragmented forests, increased wildlife populations, and ineffective policies. Recent modifications to culling orders now allow licensed gun owners to shoot wild boars, reflecting ongoing tensions between wildlife conservation and agricultural needs."

456be4c183cc5062f98e1883b4e54e11,"[DOC 1] New Delhi : More than four decades after a landmark ruling on death sentence cases, a bench in the Supreme Court has made psychological evaluation of the condemned prisoner mandatory, along with seeking a report on the inmate’s conduct at the time of examining whether the gallows remains the only fitting punishment.

The measure has been adopted by a bench, headed by justice Uday U Lalit, which took recourse to the spirit of the Supreme Court’s verdict in Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab (1980). This verdict established the doctrine of “rarest of rare” crime in handing down capital punishment while mandating a comparative analysis of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in connection to the accused.

Taking a cue from the Bachan Singh verdict, justice Lalit, in a series of death sentences cases, has recently held that “complete assistance” to the court in such matters would necessitate the production of not just the evidence in the case but also the latest state of the mental health of the prisoner.

“In terms of law laid down by the Constitution bench of this court in Bachan Singh, relevant material touching upon the issues concerning mitigating factors ought to have been produced on record...” the judge stated in several of his orders starting last year.

The usual practice in the top court has been to stay the execution of the prisoner on the first date of hearing while adjourning the case to a later date. But justice Lalit has opined that the assessment of various factors pertaining to the condemned prisoner before beginning of the final arguments would effectively assist the court in ascertaining the suitable punishment.

“The assessment as regards conduct of the accused, if made in advance before the learned counsel for both sides advance their submissions, will be helpful in every respect,” said the judge in his three different but identically worded orders in January and February. The appeals were taken up against confirmation of death sentence by the high courts in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.

These orders directed the authorities in the state government and concerned prison department to ensure the head of a government medical care institution constitutes a suitable team for psychological evaluation of the prisoner. “We also feel that interest of justice dictates that we obtain a psychological evaluation of the petitioner,” stated these orders, asking a report to be placed before the court by a team comprising a trained psychiatrist and a psychologist.

The set of four directives included seeking a report from the probation officer on the inmate’s behaviour during incarceration. “We direct that the report of the jail administration about the nature of the work done by petitioner in jail be placed before us before the next date of hearing,” said the court orders, which directed jail authorities to cooperate with the team of experts for facilitating access and due evaluation of the prisoners.

The Bachan Singh case laid down that a court must scrutinise both the crime as well as the criminal, and then decide whether death penalty is the only suitable punishment in the facts of the case. Emphasis is to be also laid on the aggravating and mitigating factors which are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the case, it held.

In Machi Singh vs State of Punjab (1983), the Supreme Court elucidated the doctrine of “rarest of rare” and set down some guiding principles in the death sentences cases. The aggravating circumstances included the manner in which the crime was committed, motive for committing the crime, severity of the crime, and the victim of the crime. The mitigating circumstances comprised of the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of an accused, his mental health and his antecedents.

In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that unexplained delay in execution was a ground for commutation of death penalty, and an inmate, his or her kin, or even a public-spirited citizen, could file a writ petition seeking such commutation. It held that prolonging execution of death sentence has a “dehumanising effect” on condemned prisoners who have to face the agony of waiting for years under the shadow of death during the pendency of their mercy plea.

An inordinate delay would certainly have an agonising effects on their body and mind, it added.

In the same year, a Constitution bench also held that a review petition by a death-row convict will be heard by a three-judge bench in open court. Such cases were earlier being considered by two-judge benches in the judges’ chamber without any oral arguments.

“The law, for more than 40 years now, has required that a wide-range of information be brought before judges while they determine punishment. That has received very little attention and from late last year onwards, the Supreme Court has turned its attention to this long ignored aspect,” said Anup Surendranath, executive director, Project 39A at National Law University, Delhi.

Project 39A is a criminal justice research and legal aid program at the university that has worked extensively in death penalty cases.

“The enormity of the task before the Supreme Court is captured by the fact that trial courts in India have already sentenced more than 50 people to death in 2022 and often in violation of procedural and substantive laws. It is not going to be easy for the Supreme Court to bring about a balance of fairness and consistency in death penalty sentencing across courts in India but the fact that the court has chosen to address it head-on is certainly noteworthy and worthy of our appreciation,” Surendranath added.","A Supreme Court bench, led by Justice Uday U Lalit, has mandated psychological evaluation of condemned prisoners as part of the assessment to determine if the death penalty is the appropriate punishment. This decision, influenced by the landmark Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab (1980) verdict, emphasizes the need for a comprehensive evaluation, including the mental health and behavior of the prisoner. The move aims to assist the court in making a well-informed decision regarding the appropriateness of the death penalty, considering both the crime and the criminal.

ba6c8e8aed5541788fec7847f4427088,"[DOC 1] The explosion is estimated to release five times more energy than previous record holder and came from a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy hundreds of millions of light years away
Using four telescopes including the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune, astronomers have discovered the biggest explosion seen in the universe which is believed to be bigger than the big bang explosion and is estimated to release five times more energy than the previous record holder and came from a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy hundreds of millions of light years away.
The National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) said in a statement on Friday that radio data from the GMRT played an important role in helping to unravel the mystery about the nature of this explosion.

The data were taken in 2008 and were available in the observatory archive and were re-analysed by the international team of researchers to get an improved radio image of the radio source, as seen by the GMRT. It complemented very nicely with the frequency coverage of the Australian MWA telescope, while providing higher resolution for a more detailed look at the cluster.

Prof. Yashwant Gupta, Centre Director of NCRA, said “This is a great example of how archival data from the GMRT can be mined for interesting new finds and justifies the efforts and resources NCRA has put in to preserve every bit of interferometric data taken with the GMRT since its inception in 2002.”

The GMRT data are from 2008, taken with a modest bandwidth of 8 MHz using the old, legacy system of GMRT. “Today, with the upgraded GMRT, offering upto 200 MHz bandwidth in the same parts of the radio spectrum, we can do much better with observations of this kind”, said Prof. Gupta.
","Astronomers using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune, along with three other telescopes, have discovered the biggest explosion ever observed in the universe. This explosion, believed to have originated from a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy hundreds of millions of light-years away, is estimated to release five times more energy than the previous record holder. The discovery was made through the analysis of archival radio data from 2008, which were re-examined by an international team to gain more insight into the explosion's nature.

301e9f0661538cb1bb86b2e5b4b61147,"[DOC 1] Abhishek Chaubey, the director of films like Ishqiya and Udta Punjab, can compromise with how his characters look, but not the acting. He is a strong believer of the dictum – ‘If the acting is right, it covers for the character’s appearance.’ In a recent interview, Chaubey gave an example about his casting process and also shared how Kareena Kapoor and Diljit Dosanjh would never sit on set with the actress even refusing to put her makeup on for the film.

In an interview with Mashable India, the filmmaker said, “When we had conceived the character of Sartaj in Udta Punjab, he was supposed to be this mountain of a man. A proper 6 feet guy with heavy voice. Typical Punjabi look. But when we did the casting, we cast Diljit Dosanjh, who looked nothing like we imagined for the character. But, he was a great actor. He is an actual Sardar.”



Abhishek Chaubey also shared his experience of working with Kareena Kapoor in Udta Punjab. After seeing a BTS photo of himself with the actor, the filmmaker recalled, “Kareena gives this expression that she doesn’t care about what you are saying, but that’s not true. She actually listens very carefully.”

“And I will tell you something very interesting about Diljit and Kareena. They never sat on set. Usually, what happens after an actor gives his or her shot, they either return to their vanity or sit on the back with a book or so, but these two would never sit. These two would just follow me everywhere I go. Kareena is a superstar and yet she would always stand behind me and so did Diljit Dosanjh. I would ask him to sit, but he never would. I would shoot in various location in the village and Kareena would always stand and watch,” he added.

Abhishek Chaubey further praised Kareena Kapoor, saying she “knows how to mould herself” as per the requirement of the project.

The filmmaker said, “There is this great thing about Kareena. She is a true blue industry kid and she has an instinctive understanding of the kind of film and the performance that is expected of her. There is no lack of skill and craft. Whether it is a David Dhawan film or a Govind Nihalani film, she knows how to mould herself. She knew what kind of film we were making. She was aware of the kind of pitch that was needed for the performance. She wouldn’t put on makeup. I used to request her ‘thoda makeup karlo’, but she wouldn’t. She was amazing.”

Udta Punjab, starring Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor, and Diljit Dosanjh, released in 2016. The film, made on a budget of Rs 34 crore, went on to earn about Rs 100 crore globally. It was one of the highest earning film of the year.","Director Abhishek Chaubey, known for *Udta Punjab*, prioritizes acting over appearance in casting, citing Diljit Dosanjh’s performance as Sartaj despite not fitting the character’s envisioned look. He praised Kareena Kapoor’s dedication, noting she avoided makeup and shadowed him on set, showcasing her instinctive understanding of diverse film requirements. *Udta Punjab* earned critical acclaim and grossed ₹100 crore globally."

The airline is taking the “precautionary step"" to temporarily ground the fleet of 65 planes until the completion of full maintenance and inspection, Chief Executive Officer Ben Minicucci said in a statement. Flight 1282 was carrying 171 passengers and six crew members from Portland to Ontario, California, the carrier said.

The crew reported a “pressurization issue,"" according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA said they are investigating the matter. Boeing said it’s gathering more information and is in contact with the airline, and a technical team is ready to support the probe.

The incident comes as Boeing is working to rebuild confidence in the 737 Max, a crucial source of cash. The plane was a brand-new craft delivered to Alaska Airlines in October. Photos and video posted by passengers on Reddit and social messaging site X showed the window and what appeared to be an emergency exit missing from the jet.

Inspections are expected to be completed in the next few days, Minicucci said.

FlightRadar24 said the plane was in the air for about 20 minutes and reached a maximum altitude of 16,300 feet.

The aircraft didn’t appear to have suffered the type of powerful decompression that occurred on a Southwest Airlines Co. plane in 2018 when part of an exploding engine shattered a window of the Boeing 737-700, partly sucking a woman seated next to it from the plane and killing her. Video from the Alaska Air craft showed passengers seated near the gaping hole.

e6db072dfcf49d9a20743c1b1e23ba72,[DOC 1] internal and external source,"The article discusses the impact of a new ferry service connecting India's Lakshadweep islands to Sri Lanka. This service has raised concerns among Lakshadweep islanders, as it may have negative consequences for their livelihoods and local economy. Islanders fear that the ferry service could lead to increased competition in the fishing industry and affect the fragile ecosystem of the region. Additionally, there are concerns about national security, as this service could potentially be exploited for illegal activities.

The ferry service, while intended to promote tourism and trade, has sparked controversy due to the lack of consultation with the local population. Many islanders feel that their voices have not been heard in the decision-making process, and they worry about the potential adverse effects on their traditional way of life.

In summary, the new ferry service connecting Lakshadweep islands to Sri Lanka has generated unease among the islanders, primarily due to concerns about the fishing industry, environmental impact, and inadequate stakeholder consultation. This development highlights the importance of balancing economic development with the preservation of local cultures and ecosystems."
edef30c8560cd2094b14055247ad7a7e,"[DOC 1] The National Convention of Workers organised by 10 Central Trade Unions (CTU), and independent sectoral associations and federations here on Monday decided to hold year-long campaigns against the policies of the Centre. The trade unions also warned of strikes in various sectors at the end of the year if the Centre continues policies of privatisation and corporatisation of public sector.
The protests will begin with State, district and factory-level conventions and State-wide rallies, culminating into a State-wide march on August 9, the Quit India Day. The meeting resolved to fight back labour codes, policies of privatisation of public sector undertakings (PSU), sale of national resources and assets to corporates, subjugation of the Indian economy to international capital to the detriment of Indian self-reliance, sovereignty and independence. The unions condemned the “efforts of the Centre” to defend “crony capitalists” and demanded a probe into the allegations made against the Adani Group of Companies by the Hindenburg research report. Citing a recent Oxfam report, the trade union leaders cautioned against the growing disparity and inequity in the country that’s making life miserable for the common masses.

“The Government which failed on all fronts to deliver on the promises is now allowing the forces of communal hatred and polarisation under various pretext to divert the united agitations of workers, farmers and other sections of the society from their pressing issues of livelihood and survival. It is undermining the secular democratic ethos of our society by using all democratic institutions to stifle the voice of opposition to the government policies,” a statement by the trade unions said. They also resolved that workers under their unions would fight to safeguard national unity and harmonious living, and would move to defeat these policies in the national interest with all their might.

The declaration said the Centre’s policies have proved to be disastrous for the national economy, and for the unity and integrity of the country. “When we look back and take stock of the more than eight years of the BJP Rule, since 2014, it presents the picture of a government-driven onslaught on the lives and livelihood of the people and their basic rights pushing overwhelming majority of our people into unimaginable miseries, distress and destitution. Job losses and unemployment have been rising unabated,” the declaration said, demanding a white paper on economy.

They demanded that the MGNREGA scheme be expanded to 200 days in a year with an increased remuneration, and a similar scheme brought in for urban areas as well. “But the government has drastically reduced the budgetary allocation; the number of work days has come down to less than 50 days per year; even the reduced allocation is returned unutilised. Drastic cut in budgetary allocations has been made in almost all welfare schemes and peoples-related projects,” the declaration said.

They also demanded universal, government-funded social security and pension schemes, scrapping of the “retrograde market driven” National Pension System (NPS), and demanded the restoration of the old pension scheme (OPS). “But the Government is moving in the opposite direction; the Finance Minister arrogantly refused to scrap the NPS. We express our support and solidarity to the movement of various forums for restoration of OPS. We demand implementation of Supreme Court judgement on EPS 95 and minimum pension in EPS 95 to be raised to ₹ 8000 per month,” the statement added.","The National Convention of Workers, organized by 10 Central Trade Unions (CTU) and independent sectoral associations, has announced plans to hold year-long campaigns against the Centre's policies.

5d6f16debd55b3e25b905bd91bcc8baa,"[DOC 1] With six days of the 10-day police remand of Ravi Kant Sharma exhausted, the police is yet to get some critical answers to its queries.

Highly-placed sources in the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police said while Ravi Kant Sharma was cooperating with the interrogators, he had so far successfully evaded or avoided answering some of the crucial questions. Trained as he is in police interrogation, former IG (Prisons) seems to have an upper hand so far.

With the hands of the police tied, they cannot resort to some of the other methods that they normally use on lesser mortals. Since the case has caught the media attention, the police is also videotaping the entire interrogation as a precautionary measure to counter any allegations of high-handedness or torture subsequently.

The sources said even during the face-to-face with another suspect, Ved Parkash, alias Kallu, who is also in police remand, Ravi Kant Sharma was cool and confident. He is reported to have been taken for the face-to-face to Ashoka Hotel here where the alleged conspiracy to eliminate Shivani was hatched.

Ravi Kant Sharma felt irritated if he was questioned for long hours. He had been arrested on the basis of the statement of other suspects, the sources said.

He is reported to have told his interrogators that being a journalist, Shivani used to come to his office and it had nothing to do with the murder case. The documents recovered from Shivani’s Nav Kunj apartment were not given by him. The sources said the police had planned to take him to Mumbai where he had met Shivani, but the plan had been cancelled as only four days were left of his remand and the focus was only on interrogation in the Capital.

“Senior police officers have been regularly reviewing the progress of the interrogation and chalking out new strategies to break Ravi Kant Sharma. These include making him sleep on the floor providing him ordinary meals and treating him like an ordinary criminal.

Suspended Haryana IG, Prison, Ravi Kant Sharma, prime suspect in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case, has moved an application before a city court seeking the release of his assets worth nearly Rs 2 crore, including bank accounts, attached by the Delhi police before his surrender.

Metropolitan Magistrate J. P. Narain, before whom the application was moved by Sharma’s counsel Mohit Mathur, issued notice to the police, asking them to file reply by October 8.

R. K. Sharma in his application submitted that law did not permit the police to hold on to his property after he had surrendered before a court in Ambala.","In the ongoing Shivani Bhatnagar murder case, Ravi Kant Sharma, a key suspect and former Haryana IG, remained elusive in interrogation, dodging significant questions during police custody. With limited options due to his expertise in police methods, authorities have cautiously videotaped the interrogation. Sharma remained composed during a confrontation with another suspect and denied association with documents found at Shivani's place. He applied for the release of assets worth nearly Rs 2 crore, held by the police after his surrender, contending that retaining his property post-surrender was not legally permissible. A court issued notice to the police, instructing a response by October 8."

2f334f4c2d8fe3125eac9fcb32d166ce,"[DOC 1] Refusing to vacate the stay on the Madras High Court hearing appeals of J. Jayalalithaa, the Supreme Court today declined to adjourn proceedings before its five-judge Constitution Bench where her appointment as Chief Minister despite conviction has been challenged.

The five-judge Bench headed by Mr Justice S. P. Bharucha decided to go ahead with the hearing of six petitions challenging Jayalalithaa’s appointment rejecting a plea by her counsel K.K. Venugopal, who said the high court should be allowed to go ahead with the three appeals she had filed challenging her conviction in these cases.

Mr Justice Bharucha said her application seeking the vacation of the stay along with the petition filed by special prosecutor K. V. Venkatapathy, who has sought transfer of the appeals from the Madras High Court to another high court, will be heard on Friday.

During the hearing of the six petitions, the bench comprising Justice Bharucha, Justice G.B. Pattanaik, Justice Y.K. Sabharwal, Justice Ruma Pal and Justice Brijesh Kumar took strong exception to numerous telegrams received by the court purportedly sent by members of Madras Bar Association calling Venkatapathy a “liar”.

“This is not done. I expect this to stop immediately as this is absurd,” Mr Justice Bharucha remarked, making Mr Venugopal observe that this was “stupid” on the part of the senders.

Racing against the November 13 deadline for being elected to the state Assembly to continue as Chief Minister, Ms Jayalalithaa yesterday filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking the vacation of the stay restraining the Madras High Court from hearing appeals challenging her conviction in the Tansi land scam and hotel cases.

Right at the beginning of the hearing, counsel for the Tamil Nadu Government P.P. Rao raised several preliminary objections including that the petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution had failed to mention as to which fundamental right of the petitioners had been affected by continuance of Jayalalithaa as the Chief Minister.

However, the Bench said it involved a matter of great constitutional importance and suggested to Mr Rao to raise the objections during his arguments.

Opening the arguments for petitioner B. R. Kapoor, Former Attorney General Ashok Desai contended that a person who has been appointed as a minister without being a member of the Assembly should have on the date of appointment the requisite qualification to get elected to the House within six months.

Mr Desai said Ms Jayalalithaa was barred by the Election Commission from contesting elections due to her conviction on three counts and hence did not possess the requisite qualification to become a member.

The arguments will continue tomorrow.

During arguments, on the question whether a convicted person be appointed the Chief Minister without her conviction being set aside by higher courts, Attorney General Soli Sorabjee said if this was allowed it would strike at the root of the democratic polity intended to be implemented by the makers of the Constitution.

If there was a substantive disqualification operating against a person to be chosen as the Chief Minister, as was the case of Ms Jayalalithaa due to her convictions in corruption cases, that person could not be appointed to the post, Mr Sorabjee said.

Appearing for Mr Selvaraj, a DMK leader, senior advocate Fali S. Nariman contended that if a Chief Minister was convicted, he had to be disqualified from membership of the House and his chief ministership goes.

Alternatively, if a person was convicted, he could never be chosen to become the Chief Minister, he said adding “what cannot be done directly, should not be permitted to be done indirectly.”

Appearing for Pradep Chautala and Dhananjay Chauhan, senior advocate Anil Devan wondered whether the constitutional rule of law had become so weak in India that a convicted person could hold the office of Chief Minister.

All three — Sorabjee, Nariman and Devan — contended that if this was so tomorrow a convicted dacoit or a murderer could stretch the interpretation to hold the office of the Prime Minister.

d20806c3265a51d81038f325092fd3d5,"[DOC 1] New Delhi : The government is alarmed by a surge in imports of Chinese finished goods such as electrical machinery, furniture, medical instruments, and implements, including kitchen cutlery, spoons and forks worth billions of dollars, which negates its strategy of Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, two officials aware of the development said.

While imports of raw materials and intermediaries from China are “good imports” as they help Indian firms manufacture value-added items, large-scale imports of finished Chinese goods are a matter of concern, they said, requesting anonymity.

There is no rationale for importing items under HS Code 85 worth $21.61 billion in January-November 2021 alone. Similarly, $17.68 billion imports under HS 84 and $1.97 billion under HS 94 were unnecessary, as most items could have been produced locally, one of them said. “It is surprising that India is importing capital goods and machinery worth about $20 billion every year from China. Cumulatively, it is $200 billion in 10 years, which we could have easily saved through local manufacturing. With such demand, we could have set up a manufacturing base for capital goods in India”, the second person said.","The Indian government is concerned about the significant increase in imports of Chinese finished goods, including electrical machinery, furniture, medical instruments, and kitchen utensils, which contradicts its Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative. While imports of raw materials and intermediaries are considered beneficial for domestic manufacturing, the influx of finished Chinese goods is seen as problematic. In particular, imports under HS Codes 85, 84, and 94 amounted to billions of dollars, raising questions about the necessity of such imports when many of these items could be produced domestically. The government officials highlighted the staggering figure of $20 billion annually spent on importing capital goods and machinery from China, emphasizing the missed opportunity to develop a robust manufacturing base in India."

13524e74536b7a7bc7463b3decbb91ab,"[DOC 1] Since the early 1990s, there has been a sense of optimism with regards to India’s economic progress. The process of liberalisation during 1991 brought with it a sense of hope regarding a dramatic turnaround in the country’s economic fortunes. While the nation’s growth did accelerate from the 1980s onwards, however, it wasn’t comparable to other emerging economies, including China.

The first decade of the 21st century was believed to be India’s time as it had a Government that was looking at the next generation of economic reforms. These transformations happened and the country witnessed the first serious privatisation of several public sector enterprises (PSEs) along with a drastic reduction in small savings rates. India’s macroeconomic situation was stable and gradually growth started to increase along with its investment rates. This growth continued till 2007, after which it started to lose steam due to lack of economic reforms and then the 2008 crisis hit the country along with the rest of the world.

While many thought the impact of the 2008 crisis wasn’t as much on India as elsewhere, the reasons behind this were the policy instruments which were deployed to address the risks that emerged. These instruments, combined with a lack of reforms and an entitlement-based regime brought a fresh macroeconomic challenge in the second decade of the 21st century.

Two decades have elapsed and India is yet to justify the sense of optimism that prevailed at the start of the century. But to be fair, the second decade wasn’t that bad considering that India’s growth in 2014, 2015 and 2016 was fairly decent even when one ignores the fact that it witnessed two successive droughts in 2014 and 2015. The country’s macroeconomic situation has improved significantly since 2014 and the Government has undertaken several reforms that will have long-term growth implications such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and the  Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA).

Despite these reforms, growth slowed towards the end of 2018 and throughout the first half of 2019. This has led people to question whether the third decade will be any different from the previous two decades. However, there are compelling reasons that point at how this time, it will be different. For starters, the current slowdown is not because of any inherent structural factors but is a direct outcome of the financial sector stress which spread over from banks to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). The reasons behind the build-up of this stress are more to do with reckless lending during the first decade of the century as the attempt to fix it started only post the introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act. ","Since the 1990s, India's economic optimism has been tempered by growth rates not matching those of other emerging economies like China. The early 2000s saw promising reforms and stable macroeconomic conditions, but growth slowed post-2007 due to a lack of reforms and the 2008 global crisis. Despite improvements in the second decade, recent slowdowns have raised doubts. However, reforms like GST, IBC, and RERA indicate long-term growth prospects. The current slowdown is attributed to financial sector stress, stemming from reckless lending in the early 2000s. But with reforms underway, there's optimism that India's third decade will witness sustained growth."

Modi said the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, would transform agriculture and empower millions of farmers after the bills were approved by a voice vote amid disruptions.

The Bharatiya Janata Party, with 86 MPs, won the day with support from YSR Congress Party, Biju Janata Dal and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Congress, SAD, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Left opposed it.

The opposition and some NDA partners demanded that the two bills should be sent to a parliamentary committee for greater scrutiny but were unable to muster the required numbers.

“For decades, the Indian farmer was bound by various constraints and bullied by middlemen. The bills passed by Parliament liberate the farmers from such adversities. These bills will add impetus to the efforts to double the income of farmers and ensure greater prosperity for them. Our agriculture sector is in desperate need of the latest technology that assists the industrious farmers. Now, with the passage of the bills, our farmers will have easier access to futuristic technology that will boost production and yield better results. This is a welcome step,” Modi tweeted after the passage of bills.

He said the system of minimum support price or MSP and government procurement will remain.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured that there will be no change in MSP and this bill will benefit the farmers. The Union government has taken several steps to ensure that income of farmers increases,” said agriculture minister N.S. Tomar in his reply to the Rajya Sabha.

The opposition’s key concerns are that the bills will hurt MSP, promote corporatization of the farm sector, attack India’s federal structure (agriculture and markets are state subjects) and that they were drafted without consulting farm bodies.

“These bills are ill-conceived and ill-timed and Congress party completely rejects it. We are not ready to sign death warrants of farmers on this. Punjab and Haryana’s economy will get completely finished,” Pratap Singh Bajwa, a senior Congress leader, said in the House.

The Congress demand for sending the bills for further parliamentary scrutiny was also supported by the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Telangana Rashtra Samiti.

“What is the compulsion to bring the bills now?... Why is the government not ready to debate and discuss the bills? Why is the government not ready for greater scrutiny?” Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party told the House.

Several opposition MPs stormed the well of the House and protests continued even after Rajya Sabha was adjourned. Taking a strong stand against deputy chairman Harivansh, who was chairing the House while the bills were being passed, 12 opposition parties have now moved a no-confidence motion against him.

The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, seeks to give freedom to farmers to sell produce outside the notified APMC market yards (mandis) and is aimed at facilitating remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, seeks to give farmers the right to enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters, or large retailers for the sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price.

A third Bill—The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020—seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities and do away with the imposition of stock holding limits. It is scheduled to be moved separately in the Rajya Sabha. All the three bills have already been passed by the Lok Sabha.","

2365365c3276af16e9f9bb9048419ade,"[DOC 1] We all lead busy lives, and it can be hard to remember to eat healthily. Sometimes, it’s easier to just grab food off the shelf, thinking only of the convenience and not of the nutritional value. Processed foods are always on-hand, which is why they make so much money for manufacturers. And they’ve saved us time and energy in the past. But, at what cost? 

Many of the products on this list are staples of our daily diet, from Coke to Twinkies. However, if not eaten in strict moderation (or avoided completely) they can lead to long-term health problems, according to cardiologists and other professionals. Some of these products are clearly harmful, but because they’re lucrative moneymakers they stay on the shelves anyway. Others are less obvious, but when eaten in great quantities can have nasty side effects. 

1. Diet Cola
Manufacturer: Various
Est. Price: $1.19 per can*

Diet cola portrays itself as a healthy alternative to regular cola. After all, it’s sugar-free! And, it has no calories. It’s often been the go-to drink for dieters everywhere. Though Mayo Clinic says that it is okay if consumed in minimal quantities, people who drink more than a can a day could be headed for some serious harm.

According to Healthline, studies have shown that diet colas aren’t so “diet’ after all. Artificial sweeteners can lead to chronic kidney disease, tooth decay (because of the acidic pH level), and an increased risk of osteoporosis, depression, and heart disease. More studies are needed to be 100% sure, but you might want to cut back on diet cola or avoid it totally. 

2. Hot Dogs
Manufacturer: Oscar Mayer, Sabrett, Hebrew National, and more
Est. Price: $2.50-$6 per 12-pack*

Hot dogs are highly processed foods that contain many ingredients other than animal meat. Among them is maltodextrin, which, if consumed in excess, can cause damage to the intestines and stomach.
Additionally, a serving of hot dogs has 33% of the recommended daily sodium intake. As if that were not enough, hot dogs usually list “poultry meat” among their ingredients, an ambiguous term that raises doubts about the true origin of the meat they contain. Considering this, it’s surprising just how many of these are sold at stores like Kroger each year.

3. Breakfast Sandwiches
Manufacturer: Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, Tim Horton’s, and more 
Est. Price: $3-$5 per sandwich*

It might be tempting to quickly grab a breakfast sandwich from a fast-food restaurant like McDonald’s, Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, and Tim Horton’s. And, there’s no denying that these sandwiches are delicious. However, you could be doing your body a real disservice by eating one every day. Though once in a while isn’t a problem, breakfast sandwiches are high in cholesterol. According to The Nutrition Twins, eating a fast-food breakfast sandwich three times a week can make you gain eight pounds a year, thanks to the three-hundred extra calories from the sandwich that you wouldn’t otherwise get if you stuck to eating at home. It makes you think twice about that McDonald’s McMuffin, doesn’t it? 

4. American Cheese Slices
Manufacturer: Sandwich Mate, Kraft, Whitehall, and more
Est. Price: $3.99 per jar*

Imitation cheese often has misleading packaging. These products, instead of being made with ingredients like milk fat the way normal cheese is, have vegetable oils, trans fats, flavorings, and preservatives. All of these ingredients make imitation cheeses much less healthy than real cheeses. You can identify imitation cheeses among other things, because they are considerably less expensive than real cheese.

5. Commercial Salad Dressings
Manufacturer: Newman’s Own, Hidden Valley, Wishbone, Kraft, and more 
Est. Price: $2-$4 per bottle* 

Vegetables are super healthy, but the problem is that a lot of them don’t exactly taste great on their own. You can make a super-deluxe salad, but it’ll be a little boring unless you add dressing. And that’s fine, but you might want to stay away from commercial salad dressings. Many of them are loaded with vegetable oils, sugar, and trans fats, all of which are unhealthy. They also tend to contain artificial chemicals. These unhealthy ingredients take away from the benefits of the salad. Instead, try making your own salad dressing from olive oil, vinegar, and a dash of salt and pepper.  Next time you’re shopping at Costco, take a harder look at the label. 

6. Pre-Packaged Cupcakes
Manufacturer: Various
Est. Price: $2.99 per box*

Pre-packaged cupcakes are a delicious dessert, but their nutritional content will leave you with a very bad taste in your mouth. Sadly, most of these packs contain almost three times the recommended daily value of sugar. Another ingredient is high fructose corn syrup, which can contribute to the development of high blood pressure or metabolic syndrome. Excessive consumption of this product can also cause obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver, among other gnarly diseases. Like anything else, these should be eaten in moderation.

7. Gummy Bears
Manufacturer: Haribo 
Est. Price: $4.99 per pound* 

Each bag of Gummy Bears contains just 0.2 pounds of gummies. However, this small amount hides the equivalent of 12 teaspoons of sugar. This is between two and three times the recommended daily intake for a child. In addition to the risks that come with excessive sugar intake, Gummy Bears also contain artificial ingredients such as petroleum-based dyes, which can contribute to the development of problems like attention deficit or hyperactivity. A pack of Haribo from Walmart might only cost you a couple of bucks, but is it worth it? 

8. Instant Ramen
Manufacturer: Maruchan Soup 
Est. Price: $0.13 per packet*

Maruchan Soup is a very popular meal for its affordable price, at just thirteen cents a packet. It’s also super-easy it is to prepare. However, due to its low fiber content, a serving of this soup is hardly going to satisfy you. In addition, Maurchan Soup is very high in sodium: each container provides half the recommended daily value. Consuming this product frequently can cause problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, among other ailments.

9. Cheap Bread
Manufacturer: Various
Est. Price: $0.88 per loaf*

Cheap white bread is essential for making practical lunches to take to school and the office. It won’t break the bank, costing less than $1 per loaf. But one of the reasons why this product is consumed so frequently is that it can become addictive. This is because it contains sugar, which helps in the fermentation process of bread. In addition, a lot of brands use a high amount of fat and salt that, in excess, can harm your health. Also, most of these loaves of bread do not have much fiber, so it will hardly make you full.

10. Pancakes
Manufacturer: Hungry Jack, Whole Foods, Mrs. Butterworth, and more 
Est. Price: $2-$4 per box*

Although they are one of the favorite breakfasts of children and adults, pancakes are not particularly healthy. For starters, they tend to have high amounts of salt and preservatives that should be avoided in a balanced diet. In addition, they usually contain trans fats, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Some of them also have partially hydrogenated soybean oil, which is not one of the healthiest fats out there. But, let’s face it, did any of us really think eating at every day was good for our health? ","In our fast-paced lives, convenience often trumps nutritional value, leading to the widespread consumption of processed foods. Despite their ubiquity, many of these products pose long-term health risks, as highlighted by cardiologists and health professionals. Here are some commonly consumed items and their associated health concerns:

1. Diet Cola: Marketed as a healthier alternative due to being sugar-free, diet colas may have drawbacks. Studies suggest that artificial sweeteners can contribute to chronic kidney disease, tooth decay, and an increased risk of osteoporosis, depression, and heart disease.

2. Hot Dogs: Highly processed and containing ingredients beyond animal meat, hot dogs may include maltodextrin, which can harm the intestines and stomach. Additionally, their high sodium content poses health risks.

3. Breakfast Sandwiches:While convenient, frequent consumption of fast-food breakfast sandwiches high in cholesterol can contribute to weight gain and other health issues.

4. American Cheese Slices: Imitation cheeses with vegetable oils, trans fats, flavorings, and preservatives are less healthy than real cheeses, often identifiable by their considerably lower cost.

5. Commercial Salad Dressings: Loaded with vegetable oils, sugar, trans fats, and artificial chemicals, commercial salad dressings may undermine the health benefits of salads. Homemade alternatives with olive oil and vinegar are recommended.

6. Pre-Packaged Cupcakes: Delicious but high in sugar and containing ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, excessive consumption may contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems.

7. Gummy Bears: Despite their small size, gummy bears pack a significant amount of sugar, contributing to risks associated with excessive sugar intake. Artificial ingredients like petroleum-based dyes can also pose health concerns.

8. Instant Ramen: Convenient and affordable, instant ramen is low in fiber and high in sodium, leading to potential health issues such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol with frequent consumption.

9. Cheap Bread: Inexpensive white bread, often consumed for its addictive qualities due to added sugar, high fat, and salt content, lacks sufficient fiber and may pose health risks when consumed excessively.

10. Pancakes: Popular for breakfast but not particularly healthy, pancakes often contain high amounts of salt, preservatives, trans fats, and partially hydrogenated soybean oil, contributing to cardiovascular risks with regular consumption."

An enthusiastic Kumkum Roy Chaudhary was seen congratulating Ravi, while Nawab Jafar Mir Abdullah took his time penning a long note in the visitor’s diary. “Just look at these pictures, lagta hi nahi hai aaj ka Lucknow hai. If only we manage to preserve our monuments in as pristine a condition as in these photographs,” he commented.
Travel tales: With the holiday season just having ended, the do had Lucknowites sharing tales from their travel diaries with friends they met after a gap of some days. Tanu and Tanuj Narain, just back from a trip to Nainital the night before, could be heard talking about it and Jayant Krishna too was heard telling an acquaintance, “For all of last month and a half I was travelling. But I made sure I was here for the exhibition as my son too has put up his work.” Later, Priti Chawla and Krishna held an avid discussion on “Butterflies”, the play in which Priti had acted.

29dc178d5bc31d9c74703f01cfacf4f5,"[DOC 1] The second day of the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week (WIFW) continued in much the same vein as day one – the focus remained on good fashion, and there were no celebs on the ramp. While the vibrancy and colour of the first day was missing on the ramp, there was a lot more quirkiness on display.
Aneeth Arora
Aneeth Arora’s collection was an effort to blend an international aesthetic with the versatility of Indian textiles like jamdani and mal, which the designer has been working on with weavers from West Bengal. Her monochromatic collection was dotted with dresses and jamdani jackets, and her use of ikat scarves might bring back the kaffiyeh trend soon. Said Harangad Singh, “Her finishing is impeccable.”

Rimzim DaduHer label is called ‘my village’, and she could very well create one for herself. Rimzim’s clothes were all about exploring structure, dimension and geometry. The 3D textures designed in broken geometrical patterns were the high points of the collection. It was a predominantly monochromatic collection, with fabrics like light organza, silk-voile and viscose jersey. Said Rahul Mishra, “It was a futuristic collection that seemed right for the present. Rimzim’s texturing was brilliant.”

Anand BhushanAnand showed his love for foliage, and added gridlock pattern embroidery to it. There were ensembles with interlocked chains, grids and cubes. Colours like pastel yellow and green in the collection spelt delicate spring, but added an international appeal to the clothes. The beaded dresses towards the end were chic and a representation of city architecture. Suhani Mahajan said, “He took up a great concept.”

Kallol Datta
Kallol Datta’s first departure from black turned out to be an interesting excursion. Usually known for his strong motifs, Kallol recreated new patterns with images of sperm and cutlery. So, the sperm sari became a talking point, as did the shoes with the sperm pattern, and the dresses with the cutlery print. The looks were also dotted with barcodes and pacifiers. Said Rimzim, “It was a mature collection, and his use of the sperm motif was very intelligent.”

Little Shilpa
Little Shilpa’s abstract collection explored various materials included acrylic, lace and net. There were lace gloves and the looks were extremely experimental, a la Lady Gaga. The elaborate headgear and accessories were tempered with powdery hues that worked well. Said Rimzim, “She combined delicate, feminine elements like lace with more masculine elements like the acrylic bustier.”

Wendell Rodricks
Goan designer Wendell Rodricks brought the art of the Kunbi tribe of Goa on the ramp. After years of research, the designer revived the art of weaving the Kunbi sari practiced by this tribe. Rodricks gave this traditional weaving practice a taste of modernity, and to Goa, a celebrated sari worn by the President and Priyanka and Sonia Gandhi, among many others. Georgette, jersey, cotton and jacquard were used to make summery dresses, sarongs, tunics and jackets. Rodricks displayed a few pieces for men as well, mostly cotton kurtas worn with slim pants. Nina Pillai said, “When someone is reviving the tradition of India so beautifully, one has to attend their show.”

Samant Chauhan
Samant Chauhan’s dresses looked diaphanous and delicate. The texturing was the highlight of his garments, and the colour... what colour? His outfits were in white, different tones of it. Geometric shapes and patterns were common to the clothes, as the collection was inspired by architecture. Joy Mitra was among those who said he saw the hard work behind the clothes, which otherwise looked simple. Said he, “I am especially fond of his texturing. Even at the men’s week, he had displayed some wonderfully textured garments.”
Kavita Bhartia
A global collection that drew inspiration from a multitude of sources, Kavita Bhartia’s ‘Transculturation’ merged modern drapes with Indian silhouettes and had embroideries from across the globe. The four sections of the collection were all about having fun while looking chic, and focussed on a bright colour palette. New age saris, graffiti print bottoms and lace redefined many cliched looks. The huge, chunky, single earrings added a touch of drama and quirkiness to the clothes. Said Rina Dhaka, “She is boho at heart and that always comes through in her collection as well.”

Anju Modi
My collection is all about the colours of Krishna, and Meera,” Anju had told us before her show. She opened the show with a child holding an idol of Krishna walking the ramp. The outfits were in whites and blues, with a hint of gold here and there. “I liked the blue that Anju’s used, it’s not found easily,” said one of front row guests.

Amit Aggarwal
He perhaps got the loudest applause of the day. As each model walked past, the audience would gasp at the audacity of the outfit – textured, and forced into patterns. In what looked like geometric patterns – only they were made from fabric – the outfits moulded themselves over the models. “The outfits were ahead of time. Definitely eye-catching,” said Ambika Pillai.

Pankaj and Nidhi

Flowers,” was the succinct answer from Pankaj when asked about his theme. “It was an S/S collection, and spring always brings to mind nature in all its glory,” elaborated Nidhi. So, in silks, chiffons, jersey dresses, et al, there were jumpsuits, smocks, shorts, pants...

Alpana and Neeraj

Designers Alpana and Neeraj effectively blended sports wear with the 70s feel, bringing to the ramp what Tarun Tahiliani described as “a very skilful” collection. “Sports has been the talk of the town lately, how could fashion not be inspired by it?” asked Alpana. Neeraj said, “We have used a lot of sheers and jersey, and many colours, as it’s an S/S collection.”

13beb62e16e2b2536beb54f5c5a459de,"[DOC 1] Asserting that the Prime Minister has already constituted a sub-committee headed by Defence Minister A K Antony to look into the Lokpal Bill issue,Congress Party on Tuesday termed social activist Anna Hazare’s fast unto death as premature.

“The Prime Minister has already constituted a sub-committee headed by Antony. When the process was already on,then adopting such a path is perhaps not appropriate,probably unnecessary. We respect Hazare very much,but the path he has adopted is premature,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari told reporters.","This passage reports on the **Congress Party’s response** to **Anna Hazare’s hunger strike** demanding the **Lokpal Bill**, an anti-corruption legislation aimed at establishing an independent ombudsman to investigate corruption cases.

### Key Points:

* The **Prime Minister had already formed a sub-committee** led by **Defence Minister A. K. Antony** to address the **Lokpal Bill**.
* Despite this, **Anna Hazare**, a respected social activist, began a **fast unto death**, demanding stronger and immediate action.
* Congress spokesperson **Manish Tewari** described Hazare’s move as **""premature""** and **""probably unnecessary""**, since discussions were already underway.
* While the party **acknowledged respect for Hazare**, it questioned the **timing and method** of his protest.

### Context:

This situation marked the beginning of a major public movement in India against corruption. While the government viewed Hazare's protest as untimely, for many citizens, it symbolized a long-overdue demand for transparency and accountability. The tension highlighted the **gap between public sentiment and political processes**, eventually leading to widespread support for the **Jan Lokpal movement** and significant national debate on anti-corruption laws.

We have received sanctions from both the Delhi government and the (Union) ministry of home affairs

""To prosecute one under Section 13 of the UAPA, we need sanction from the ministry of home affairs, which we have already received. For prosecution under Section(s) 16, 17 and 18 of the UAPA, we have received sanction from the Delhi government."" A source said the sanctions had been granted weeks ago

On September 16, the police had filed a chargesheet against 15 people booked in an FIR under the UAPA, under which bail is rarely granted

The accused include Jamia Millia Islamia students Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider and Asif Iqbal Tanha; Jawaharlal Nehru University students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal; former Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain; former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan and rights activist Khalid Saifi

Umar Khalid Umar, a former JNU student whose trial in a 2016 sedition case is yet to begin, was arrested three days before the UAPA chargesheet was filed. His arrest had prompted former DGP Julio Ribeiro to write to Delhi police commissioner S.N. Srivastava that he should not prolong a case by arresting people just before the filing of a chargesheet. Umar was not named as an accused in the September chargesheet, and the police will need to file a supplementary chargesheet to prosecute him. On the defensive after the riots, the Delhi government had granted sanction for prosecution also in the 2016 sedition case -- in which then JNU students were accused of chanting ""anti-national"" slogans -- after having ignored the police s requests for such sanction for a year

Legal opinion that the AAP government had received had advocated denial of sanction since a magisterial probe had found several of the videos of the 2016 sloganeering doctored, and since none of the slogans could be directly attributed to the accused

The AAP had justified the decision to grant sanction on the ground that the ""judiciary alone should decide on the merits of each case""

In July, a fact-finding report by the Delhi Minorities Commission had accused BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath, of ""fanning communal sentiments"" in the leadup to the February riots

Asked why the latest sanction had been granted despite the commission report, a state government spokesperson told this newspaper: ""This is a purely procedural matter…."" Umar has denied inciting violence. Before his arrest, he had said: ""The Delhi police are not arresting the rioters who incited and caused the largescale communal violence in the capital in February. But, instead, it is going after those who criticise the government and its policies, especially the Citizenship Amendment Act.""","Umar Khalid Faces Prosecution Under UAPA for Alleged Role in Delhi Riots
Key points:

Delhi Police received prosecution sanction from both Delhi government and central government to charge Umar Khalid under UAPA.
Chargesheet already filed against 15 others including student activists and politicians.
Khalid not named in initial chargesheet, supplementary one needed to prosecute him.
Delhi government previously denied sanction in Khalid's 2016 sedition case but granted it this time despite legal concerns.
Khalid denies inciting violence and criticizes police for targeting government critics instead of actual rioters.
Fact-finding report blames BJP leaders for instigating February riots."
cdbe80c3f953d84bf12eee3d5968288d,"[DOC 1] NEWS DESK-  For the first time in the history of cancer, tumours have disappeared from every patient involved in a drug trial. As many as 18 rectal cancer patients participated in the trial, and each of them was given the same drug.


Surprisingly, the cancer had vanished in every single patient, and was undetectable by physical examination, endoscopy, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The study describing the results was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 

According to a report published by The New York Times (NYT), Dr Luis A. Diaz Jr of  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said he knew of no other study in which a treatment completely obliterated a cancer in every patient.

“I believe this is the first time this has happened in the history of cancer,” the report quoted Dr Diaz as saying.

The trial was funded by pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. Dr Alan P. Venook, a colorectal cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study, said he also thought this was a first, and that a complete remission in every single patient is “unheard-of”.

According to the report, the rectal cancer patients had undergone gruelling treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation and surgery that could result in bowel, urinary and sexual dysfunction. Some cancer patients even required colostomy bags, which are plastic bags that collect faecal matter from the digestive tract through an opening in the abdominal wall called stoma.

The cancer patients participated in the trial thinking that they would have to undergo the procedures again after the study was over because they did not expect their tumours to disappear.

However, they were surprised when they found that their cancer had vanished, and that no further treatment was necessary.

Dr Andrea Cercek, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a co-author on the paper, said that there were a lot of happy tears, according to the report. The paper was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology on June 5, 2022.

Dr Venook added that another surprise was that none of the patients had clinically significant complications.

HOW THE DRUG WORKS
The patients were administered dostarlimab every three weeks for six months. The medication aimed to unmask cancer cells, allowing the body’s immune system to identify and destroy them naturally.


Such drugs, known as ‘checkpoint inhibitors’, usually have some kind of adverse reaction in 20% of patients who undergo the treatments. Nearly 60% of patients have severe complications, including muscle weakness. But no negative reaction was seen in the patients involved in the dostarlimab study.

Rectal cancer in the patients was locally advanced — tumors that had spread in the rectum and, in some cases, to the lymph nodes but not to other organs.

COST OF TREATMENT
The drug, if approved for mass use in future, is not going to come cheap as the trial doses cost $11,000 each or nearly Rs 8.55 lakh per dose.

The study found that on average, one in five patients have some sort of adverse reaction to dostarlimab, the drug the patients took. Dostarlimab is also known as a checkpoint inhibitor.

‘FURTHER TRIALS REQUIRED’
Most adverse reactions are easily managed, the report said. However, as many as three to five per cent of patients who take checkpoint inhibitors have more severe complications. In some cases, these complications can result in muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing and chewing.


According to Dr Venook, the absence of significant side effects means either they did not treat enough patients, or somehow, these cancers are just plain different, the report said.

Dr Hanna K Sanoff of the University of North Carolina’s Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study, said in an editorial accompanying the paper that it is not clear if the patients are cured. She added that very little is known about the duration of time needed to find out whether a clinical complete response to dostarlimab equates to cure.

According to Dr Kimmie Ng, a colorectal cancer expert at Harvard Medical School, the results were remarkable and unprecedented, but would need to be replicated.

According to the report, the first patient to join the trial was Sascha Roth, who was 38 years of age at that time. Roth noticed some rectal bleeding for the first time in 2019, but otherwise felt fine. Her gastroenterologist, who conducted a biopsy on her tumour said it is definitely cancer. Roth said that on hearing this, she completely melted down.

Roth decided to participate in the trial, but was not expecting a complete response to dostarlimab, and had planned to move to New York for radiation, chemotherapy and possible surgery after the trial ended, according to the report. She also had her ovaries removed and put back under her ribs to preserve her fertility after the expected radiation treatment.


After the trial was complete, Dr Cercek told Roth that the researchers looked at her scans, and there is absolutely no cancer. Also, she did not need any further treatment. When Roth informed her family of this, they did not believe her, she said.

Two years after the trial, Roth still does not have a trace of cancer.","In a groundbreaking trial funded by GlaxoSmithKline, a drug called dostarlimab achieved unprecedented results in treating rectal cancer. Administered every three weeks for six months, the drug completely eliminated tumors in all 18 patients, confirmed by multiple diagnostic methods. This success, detailed in the New England Journal of Medicine, marks the first instance of such comprehensive cancer remission. Unlike conventional treatments, dostarlimab caused no significant side effects in the patients, signaling a potential revolution in cancer therapy pending further trials. Researchers caution that long-term outcomes and broader applicability need continued investigation despite these remarkable initial findings."

In a fast-paced world coupled with unpredictable challenges and rapid technological shifts, there’s an increasing demand for professionals who are domain experts and display human values like respect, empathy, leadership, teamwork and more. In this context, schools and higher educational institutions are leading the way in preparing the young learners for an evolving world and ensuring their brighter future. One of the best ways to do so is via sports as this not only teaches the students the value of healthy competition but also makes them learn to embrace challenges, failures and unforeseen situations with equanimity.This is already echoed in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which now recognises sports as a critical component of experiential learning, aimed at cultivating skills such as collaboration, self-initiation, self-direction, self-discipline, teamwork, responsibility and citizenship. NEP 2020 has stressed upon the integration of sports into education stating that it is instrumental in assisting students in adopting fitness, developing life skills, promoting physical and psychological well-being, and enhancing cognitive abilities. This explicit inclusion of sports as a vital element in the school curriculum serves as a significant message to educators, highlighting the pivotal role that sports can play in the lives of young individuals, particularly those facing adversities.

Sports inculcates life skills among young leaners. It also leads to the following: 

Emotional Control: Learning to balance all types of emotions and maintaining a calm mind
Teamwork: Working and collaborating with others to achieve a goal
Perseverance: Persisting towards the goal with patience and determination
Respect: Valuing other people and oneself by showing consideration and kindness
Honesty: Being truthful to oneself and the others
Some of the key benefits of inculcating the habits of sports include: 

Goal Setting and body language: Breaking down the goal into achievable steps is the key to achieve the same. While learning this philosophy, students also learn to work together with their team, have a multi-disciplinary outlook, be more innovative, creative and adaptable. Body language reflects what a person is really thinking and a positive body language is the mark of a good leader and team person as he reflects trust, reliance and values.

Knowing strengths and weaknesses: Self-evaluation is the key to holistic growth and an open mindset. Understanding the strengths and weakness of oneself and the others helps create a strong bond and the team can work together to address anything based on this understanding and even work towards creating positive changes while working on turning around the shortcomings.

The value of discipline and hard work: Achieving growth and success, inside and outside requires a commitment to hard work and unwavering discipline. It is a good idea to maintain a schedule and follow it through. A team that collaborates, plans meticulously, and executes tasks with discipline can overcome any challenge while learning from it. In a situation when facing obstacles, it’s important to understand that there are no shortcuts. Also, it’s important to listen to everyone and be open to multiple solutions.

Balancing success and failure: Balancing success and failure are part of the same coin. Of course, failure can lead to a lot of emotions like anxiety, stress, negativity and even depression, but on the positive side, it can bring people closer, where they take ownership jointly—as a team—to every decision and outcome. To balance both these sets of emotions and face anything with an unwavering attitude is the best approach to anything in life. Through sports, students also learn to view failures as learning opportunities on the road to success rather than a setback in their journey or even the end of the road. Therefore, sports not only lead to character building and creating a strong emotional and physical well- being, but it also sets habits for life which are based on social skills and life skills.","Sports, as echoed in the National Education Policy, fosters vital life skills like teamwork, perseverance, and respect. Emotional control, goal setting, and understanding strengths and weaknesses are among the benefits, teaching discipline and the balance between success and failure. It's a cornerstone for holistic growth, shaping individuals beyond the physical realm."

Overall, the main Opposition party said the BJP government seemed to be â€œat warâ€ with the people, inflicting wounds instead of healing them. Saying that more than 50 people died in the Shramik special trains, the Congress also called on Railway Minister Piyush Goyal to resign taking moral responsibility for the loss of lives. The Congress, which has attacked the government over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, also demanded that a virtual session of Parliament be immediately convened and meetings of various parliamentary committees be held. Addressing a joint press conference, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary K C Venugopal and Congress communication department head Randeep Surjewala said Prime Minister Modi came to power making extraordinary promises. But he delivered very little, they said, be it on creating two crore jobs every year, doubling of farm income, strengthening the rupee or bringing back black money. The government, they alleged, has systematically subjugated all democratic institutions, stifled dissent, shown a complete aversion to accountability and transparency, persecuted political leaders and critics including authors, writers, thinkers and journalists, and misused investigative agencies and the Income Tax Department in the last six years. â€œThe six years of the Modi dispensation have seen fraying of bonds of empathy, fraternity and brotherhood with an increase in acts of communal and sectarian violence,â€ Venugopal said, adding that at the start of the seventh year, â€œIndia stands at a crossroads. Its citizens exhausted by the weight of this governmentâ€™s sins, ineptitude and callous insensitivity to the widespread suffering.â€ â€œOver the last six years, India witnessed a steady increase in the politics of distraction and false noise, to the point that it has become a defining mainstay of the Modi governmentâ€™s administrative style. While it served the political interests of the BJP, it came at an unprecedented economic and social cost to the nation,â€ he said. Unemployment, he said, touched a 45-year high and the GDP shows â€œGrossly Declining Performanceâ€. The six years of the Modi government also saw 32,868 bank frauds involving public money to the tune of Rs 2.70 lakh crores, Venugopal added. â€œThe six years of Modi government have proven that it prioritizes the â€˜havesâ€™ over the â€˜have-notsâ€™. The rich have gotten richer while the poor, needy and vulnerable have been abandoned. India now has the highest income inequality in 73 yearsâ€¦ Prime Minister Modi advertises his austerity and humble roots, but six years of his government have demonstrated a shocking lack of concern for the woes of the common man and worse still, demonstrates zero sense of accountability to the people,â€ he said. â€œThe Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Central Vigilance Commission, the Information Commissions and the Lok Pal look weaker, more ineffective and more unwilling to act, than ever before,â€ he said.","Saying that more than 50 people died in the Shramik special trains, the Congress also called on Railway Minister Piyush Goyal to resign taking moral responsibility for the loss of lives."

products being sold in VATable states would be priced
higher compared to those in states which had opted out of
the VAT structure.

across all states has added to cost pressures and involves
separate book keeping, firms are absorbing the additional
costs. And while firms are taking a hit on profitability in
states where sales taxes were lower than the 12.5% VAT,
they say the hit is being offset by higher sales taxes in
other states. Said A. Satishkumar, MD, Henkel Spic,
""There is an element of hit in states where sales tax was
lower than the 12.5% VAT. But on the other hand, in
states where sales tax was 14-15%, firms stand to
benefit. So the hit is being offset."" Eight states including
Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
had opted out of the VAT regime. ""The net effect on an allIndia basis is neutral, though the impact may vary from
state to state and product to product,"" said a Dabur

would fuel illegal cross-border movement of goods.
Manufacturers had raised concerns that products in non
VATable states would suffer because suppliers of raw

But this year, it’s not only the IPL, but the election fever as well which is making the life of Hindi GECs even tougher to sustain their viewer interest.

Not only this, high voltage drama in Bani – Ishq Da Kalma, Desh Ki Beti... Nandini, Doli Armaanon Ki, Ek Nayi Pehchaan are helping the channels to keep the viewership intact.

Only interesting matches of IPL matches at advance phases may impact some shows. But overall I don’t think there is any threat to GECs. No one will trade their daily course fully for an occasional fruit. Let’s not forget that most of the homes these days have two TV sets.” Even Rajan Shahi says, “IPL affects the TVT only marginally. IPL novelty factor has been on a decline over the years. Audiences love to keep track of their favourite shows. In fact, some shows actually do better during IPL. And some don't do. Since last two years, no broadcaster has told me to make any changes to combat the coming of IPL. TV is a mass medium. Just like we don’t stop eating dal chawal, we don't stop watching our favourite TV programs.” So, what is the plan of action to keep going strong with shows when these two events are grabbing attention on the prime time? “All my shows have an element of good drama.

Indian high commissioner to the UK Vikram Doraiswami and Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the UK home office, exchanged letters about the scheme, which is expected to open in March. The launch was timed to coincide with Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. The scheme will allow graduates aged 18 to 30 to stay in the other country for up to two years without needing to have a job in hand. They can look for work, work, study, do voluntary work, be selfemployed or start a business, or do whatever they wish — but they have to fund the trip themselves and find their own accommodation. Indians who come to Britain on the scheme will not be allowed to avail of state benefits. The visa cannot be extended.

The intention is that it allows graduates to be able to go to each other’s country and have the chance to live, study, work and learn about country.” He said India was interested equally in facilitating young Britons to go to India, to work there and get a sense of India.He said the aim was to facilitate young people in India and the UK to find jobs, create opportunities, do business with each other, set up start-ups, create innovation and new research and develop a longer lasting UK-India partnership. Successful participants will be selected via a ballot. As for whether 3,000 was enough places for India, Doraiswami said: “It’s a start. Wouldn’t you say 3,000 is better than before when we had didn’t have any?” When probed about accommodation challenges international students are facing in the UK, he said: “Indians don’t all have to come to London, which is where the max accommodation challenges are. The entire country is open to you. You don’t need to go to a university. You can go anywhere… You can pursue an opportunity of interest to you. Similarly British people don’t have to go to Mumbai or Delhi — they can go anywhere in India.” The scheme, which is a key part of the delivery of the 2030 roadmap signed by the PMs of both countries, comes as the UK and India get ready to commence the seventh round of negotiations of the bilateral FTA, and are deepening defence cooperation.","The UK-India Young Professionals Scheme was launched on Monday, which will allow 3,000 young Indians and Britons to live, study, and work in each other's countries for up to two years.

In Mumbai, una ciudad maravillosa en la India y el centro de Tamil Nadu (India) donde se encuentra esta publicación, los precios del alquiler han aumentado considerablemente durante las últimas dos décadas. Este fenómeno ha sido impulsado por varios factores como un crecimiento exponencial de la población metropolitana, una urbanización sin control y el constante cambio climático que afecta a Mumbai con más frecuencia. Esto conduce al aumento en los precios del terreno inmobiliario, haciendo cada vez más difícil para las personas menos adineradas encontrar viviendas de calidad dentro de la ciudad.

Los expertos argumentan que este incremento es el resultado directo de un mercado real estado y está impulsando a los hogares promedio hacia áreas suburbanas donde la vida nocturna, las escuelas e infraestructura son más bajas. Además del aumento en los precios del alquiler que ocasionan dificultades para aquellos que buscan viviendas asequibles y han disminuido el acceso de la gente con menos ingresos a espacios urbanos convenientes, este fenómeno está exacerbando la desigualdad.

La investigación revela un incremento significativo en los precios del alquiler que afecta especialmente las zonas metropolitanas de Mumbai. Las personas con ingresos medios y bajos se ven obligadas a buscar opciones residenciales menos accesibles, limitando sus horarios para desplazarse largamente por el tráfico pesado en la ciudad.

La falta de políticas efectivas que limiten este crecimiento es una preocupación común entre los expertos en inmuebles y urbanismo, ya que no hay medidas sólidas desde hace un par de décadas para frenar la expansión urbana. Los profesionales del sector sugieren políticas como zonificación estricta para controlar el desarrollo infraestructural y una mayor disponibilidad de bienes raíces para aliviar este crecimiento desmesurado, sin embargo estos sugerencias están en un futuro lejano.

La ciudad ha tenido varios intentos fracasados de implementar políticas que puedan mitigar el problema del aumento del precio del alquiler y la segregación social antes mencionada por parte de los expertos urbanistas, sin embargo estos esfuerzos no han dado resultados. Los residentes están desesperanzados acerca de encontrar una solución rápida para este problema urbano que ha crecido en Mumbai y otras ciudades como ella."

bc73a1414da9ef68fcab2271c4b8983f,"[DOC 1] Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) is likely to charge eight percent interest on the outstanding fuel bills stuck at the railway agency.

The state-owned lone petroleum organisation is planning to impose the penalty to realise its fuel bills and eliminate the tendency to not pay bills before they become due.

An inter-ministerial meeting between the power, energy and mineral resources ministry and the railways ministry will be held on Wednesday to finalise the matter, said a source at the BPC.

As per the sales and purchase agreement, the railway agency is supposed to pay fuel bills within 15 days of delivery.

However, it has failed to pay the bill as per the contract. Sometimes, bills are not paid even for a year.


Therefore, the three fuel distribution companies under the BPC demanded to amend the sales and purchase contract with the railway by adding a provision to charge interest on the dues.

Clause 11(a) of the current contract reads, ""In the event of failure by the railway for settlement of the bills against supply within the stipulated time mentioned above, the company may charge interest on outstanding bills as per the rate of Sonali Bank.""

Fuel companies proposed to amend the clause with addition of the provision to claim interest on the outstanding bills.

Syed Mehdi Hasan, director (operation and planning) of the BPC, said, ""Oil distribution companies buy energy with raw cash. However, they are incurring losses after distribution due to some big consumers like the railway.""

Therefore, they raised the demand to impose interest on outstanding bills to recover the losses, he said.

According to the BPC, the east and west zones of the Bangladesh Railway owe it around Tk58.37 crore.

Of the amount, Padma Oil Company Limited's receivable is Tk17.23 crore, Meghna Petroleum Limited's amount is Tk17.80 crore, and Jamuna Oil Company Limited's amount is Tk23.32 crore. 

Md Shamsuzzaman, director general of the Bangladesh Railway, told The Business Standard they will accept whatever decision the BPC makes.

""We both are government organisations. If we pay fines to the BPC, the amount will eventually go to the state's coffers,"" he added.","The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) is considering charging an 8% interest penalty on overdue fuel bills from the state-owned railway agency. The BPC aims to address delayed payments and discourage non-compliance with the 15-day payment period specified in the sales and purchase agreement.

Fuel distribution companies under BPC, facing losses due to delayed payments, propose amending the contract to include an interest provision. The outstanding amount from the east and west zones of the Bangladesh Railway is approximately Tk58.37 crore, with individual receivables for Padma Oil Company Limited, Meghna Petroleum Limited, and Jamuna Oil Company Limited.

Addressing the aspirations of the Gorkha community, the Prime Minister stated, “We have rescinded Article 370, we have established Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, we have resolved issues that most thought were unresolvable. We are sensitive to the aspirations of the Gorkha people. We are very close to the solution.”

Thousands of Gorkha community members were present at the public meeting with expectations that Modi might declare some developmental projects for Gorkhas in hills and plains including the long pending demand of tribal status for the left-out communities.

However, Modi who greeted the Gorkhas in Nepali language in the beginning did not mention about long pending demand of separate State nor on providing tribal status for the left-out communities.


Earlier, the Prime Minister inaugurated multiple projects of rail and road sector worth more than Rs 4500 crores for Bengal. He flagged-off a new passenger train service between Siliguri and Radhikapur and also inaugurated National Highway projects worth Rs 3,100 crores.

During the inaugural function next to the public rally at Kawakhali ground, the Prime Minister said that four laning of Ghoshpukur-Dhupguri Section of NH 27 and four-lane Islampur Bypass will reduce traffic jams in the cities of Jalpaiguri, Siliguri and Mainaguri while also providing better connectivity to the regions of Siliguri, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar

“Reaching tourist destinations such as Gangtok, Darjeeling, Dooars and Mirik will become easier”, PM Modi said, noting that it will also encourage trade, industry and the tea gardens of the region.

The Prime Minister underlined that the Northern part of West Bengal is the gateway to the Northeast and also provides trade channels with neighbouring countries. Therefore, the development of West Bengal along with the State’s northern part has been the government’s priority, he said.

Manipur University remained paralysed for months during the movement launched by MUSU, MUTA and the students demanding the removal of AP Pandey as the Vice Chancellor.
AP Pandey was appointed as the Vice Chancellor of MU in October 2016 and the demand to remove him reached its zenith in 2018. The two member independent enquiry committee comprising of  T Nandakumar Singh, former acting Chief Justice of the High Court of Meghalaya and Prof MK Choudhary, former Vice Chancellor of Tezpur University which  probed the administrative and financial irregularities of Prof AP Pandey submitted its report to the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on May 27, 2019.
Based on the findings of the enquiry committee, a show cause notice was served on Prof Adya Prasad Pandey on September 24, 2019 as to why he may not be removed from his post for the irregular financial and administrative activities including misconduct, dereliction of duties, abuse of power and lack of commitment on his part, which caused a great harm to the academic environment and bringing the University into disrepute. Responding to the show cause notice, Prof Pandey gave a point-wise reply on October 11 last year. It emerged from the examination of his reply and the records received from the MU that during the period from October 26, 2016 to May 30, 2018, Prof AP Pandey remained away for about 189 days from MU and most of his absences from the headquarters could not be justified as per records available in the university. The frequent absence of the Vice Chancellor from the headquarters (MU) affected its academic activities adversely. This displays lack of institutional commitment of Prof Adya Prasad Pandey and his failure to provide effective leadership and guidance to the university, read the dismissal order. It further asserted that Prof AP Pandey  committed various  financial irregularities in purchases and execution of works without inviting tenders in violation of    provisions of General Financial  Rules  (GFRs) and excess purchases etc  in connection with organising the 105th Indian Science Congress, installation of smart class systems through ITI, Lucknow and purchase of blank mark-sheets and OMR answer copies without calling tender(s). Prof Adya Prasad Pandey, Vice-Chancellor, Manipur University has failed miserably in performing duties assigned under Statute 3 (3) of the Manipur University Act, 2005. His acts of omission and commission are unbecoming of a person holding the post of Vice Chancellor, the order added.","The President of India, who is also the Visitor of Manipur University, has dismissed Prof Adya Prasad Pandey from the post of Vice Chancellor based on recommendations from the Ministry of Human Resource Development. The dismissal comes after months of unrest at Manipur University, with various groups demanding Prof Pandey's removal. An independent enquiry committee found administrative and financial irregularities under Prof Pandey's tenure, leading to a show cause notice being served to him. Prof Pandey's frequent absences from the university and financial irregularities were cited as reasons for his dismissal, as they negatively impacted the university's academic activities and reputation."

With no ears of any sort for it to be heard
The prime vibration
From which all creation
Came to be? Surely that’s absurd!”
From Solemn Honeycomb, by Bachchoo
The old ditty about hot days in India began with the phrase “Mad dogs and Englishmen…” Should a certain recent phenomenon prompt us to alter this slightly to “Dogs and their mad Englishmen”? I mean I just read an advertisement for “Vegan Dog Ice-Cream”. No, gentle reader, you aren’t hallucinating! The five-litre package for vegan dog ice-cream sells at £120 and is being vigorously marketed and sold.
It’s not the only brand on the market. There’s COOL DOG DOGGY ICE-CREAM for £30 a tub. Then there’s FROZZY’S DOG ICE-CREAM selling at £32+ for 12 bite-size tubs.
Here’s how it’s advertised:
“Frozzys -- The lactose-free lickable frozen yoghurt ‘Ice Cream’ for dogs. The tasty Cranberry flavour is rich in vitamins, minerals & fibre. It’s the healthy everyday complimentary food for good doggies! Made in the UK from all-natural ingredients.” It goes on to list its key qualities:
*Rich in calcium
*Contains vitamins & minerals
*Low in calories
*Lactose-free
There are many more and I won’t crowd this column with them -- you get the point.
You rightly assume that I have, through my short and happy life, vast experience of both pet dogs and ice-creams. In my boyhood in Pune, we had five dogs at one time in the house. They were fed one meal a day consisting of rice floating in meat broth, cheap meat on bones and mixed boiled vegetables left over from family meals. They gobbled this mess up avidly and we assumed with deep satisfaction. Even in the moderate heat of Pune’s summer, they were never given ice-cream.
Which was in our childhoods a treat. Of course, there was the common or garden variety -- flavoured ice on a stick -- known as “ice-fruit”. In our school it was sold by a vendor on a bicycle, known to us as Manji. On the handlebar of his bicycle, he hung several large thermos flasks in which the one, two and four-anna ice-fruits were carried. I suppose these were manufactured somewhere in the city and vendors like Manji were sent out to retail them.
Then something changed in Pune. A restaurant chain called Kwality established itself and began to make and sell relatively sophisticated ice-cream -- not only in the restaurant itself but in three-foot cube containers on wheels attached in front of peddled cycles. One of the Kwality vendors targeted our school and turned up in our break times outside the walls and gates as a rival to Manji, who consequently lost almost all his clientele to this “superior” brand, which even called itself ice-cream.
Manji tolerated the competition docilely for a few days but then the whole school witnessed a physical fight between him and the Kwality man in the quiet street outside the school walls. The squabble saw Manji off. He didn’t return. I fancied myself as a loyal client of his and regretted his departure. Not so my classmate, one Vasant Sirur, who declared that it was good riddance, as in his view and idiom “Manji was under Kwality’s balls”.
Then in our college days, a gentleman called Maganbhai opened a stall in the market yard where he and his employee churned by hand several flavoured ice-creams in a mould inside a wooden bucket filled with crushed ice. It was delicious and became a regular and prosperous haunt of teenagers.
Then trouble stuck the stall. It was rumoured that the police threatened to close it down, saying it was infested with rats and cockroaches. Maganbhai, it was said, refused to pay the bribe the cops demanded to turn a blind eye and instead was prosecuted and framed and went to jail. When he came out, he restarted his stall and was as popular as ever. We suggested to him that he change the name of the stall to “Badnaam ice-cream”. I don’t think he did.
Now, I don’t know where the idea for dog ice-cream came from. It’s surely biologically obvious that dogs will eat boiled rats if that’s what’s available. I did know that my uncle in Mumbai would treat his female dog to slices of banana and mango, but not to ice-cream.
Obviously, the Doggy ice-creamwallas are prospering in the UK as more and more brands hit the market.
Are the British pet owners who feed their dogs the now more cheaply available Pea and Vanilla flavoured variety from the economic supermarket Aldi, crazy, eccentric, deluded by marketing dietary propaganda or just pet-loving and indulgent? Was our family’s menu of cheap meat, rice, oily soup and left-over vegetables a manifestation of neglect, of contempt or even of “speciesism”?
Our five dogs, I insist, lived very healthy and robust lives and, apart from the one killed by being run over by a bus when he was indiscriminately crossing the street, lasted through a “good innings”, as the Brits say.
I incline, gentle reader, to regard this popularity of doggy varieties of ice-cream as misguided but loving indulgence. And this is no part of a hoax, but I have to add that not only is there canine ice-cream on sale, there is now an extremely brisk trade in specially marketed caviar for dogs. Bring on doggy-champagne? Canine Claret?? Bow-wow!",The Doggy ice-creamwallas are prospering in the UK as more and more brands hit the market.

The practice to use yellow clay was discontinued in the royal Gaekwad family’s Ganesha idol some 35-40 years ago, and the trend shifted to black clay.
However, thanks to the lockdown devotees will this year get an opportunity to get darshan of Lord Ganesha made by the Chavan family using the rare yellow clay. The family has been the royal idol makers since 1927.
“We have been using clay from Bhavnagar to make Lord Ganesha’s idols for almost nine decades now. We start making the idols about four months ahead of the festival as the royal Gaekwad family’s Ganesh idol has to be made to perfection,” said Mangesh Chavan, member of the family.

“However, due to the lockdown, we couldn’t bring the black clay from Bhavnagar which we have been using for four decades now. We first thought of waiting for some more time, but amid the uncertainty, we decided to go ahead and start making the idol during the lockdown itself,” Chavan told TOI.

“Fortunately, we had a stock of the yellow clay that we had stored some 35 years ago as souvenir — which is now being utilized to make the royal idol. This will be a rare idol made of yellow clay as it is no longer available anywhere,” Chavan added.

The makers claimed that yellow clay is better as it binds better, making it a perfect material for making idols. While making the Ganesha idol from the yellow clay for the first time, I was reliving the moments when my forefathers used it to make Ganesh idols for the royal family,” 42-year-old Chavan added.","A gold-colored clay, historically used for crafting the royal Gaekwad family's Ganesha idol since 1927, is making a comeback after nearly four decades. The tradition of using yellow clay was discontinued around 35-40 years ago, replaced by black clay from Bhavnagar.

However, due to the lockdown, the Chavan family—royal idol makers since 1927—has turned to their old stock of rare yellow clay to craft this year’s idol. “We couldn’t source black clay from Bhavnagar due to restrictions, so we decided to use the yellow clay we had preserved as a souvenir for 35 years,” said Mangesh Chavan.

Chavan noted that yellow clay is superior in binding and shaping, making it ideal for idol-making. “Working with it again felt like reliving the traditions of my forefathers,” he added. This rare yellow clay idol is set to be a special sight for devotees this Ganesha festival"

c8f145915d083d98e5728121206fc163,"[DOC 1] SEWA literally means service in many Indian languages. But as the acronym for Ahmedabad-based Self Employed Women’s Association, sewa holds a much larger meaning — from developing self-esteem and self-empowerment in women to gender role reversal and above all, promotion of a cultural tradition.

Set up in 1972 by the well-known social reformer and visionary, Ilaben Bhatt, this unique organisation of women artisans commands a membership of 530,000 today. More than 100,000 are from village of Kutch — a region known for its rich textile heritage and being the repository for some of the most vibrant hand embroidery styles ever created. SEWA has harnessed the age-old skills of its gifted members into producing beautifully embroidered bedcovers, table linen, wall hangings, hand bags, wallets, kurtas, tops, shirts, jackets, stoles and scarves. Women are paid on-the-spot for their efforts, even before their work finds a customer at the market place.

""We are doing what our mothers and grandmothers have been for ages,"" says Chanduba Sodha, a master craftswoman in patchwork, who has been with SEWA for the past 15 years. ""The only difference now is that this work brings us joy and freedom — freedom from being dependant upon anybody.""

Traditionally, women of Kutch (as in most others other parts of rural Gujarat) are trained in various forms of embroidery from their very childhood and when the bride enters her new home, custom demands that she carry embroidered bed spreads, pillow cases, quilt covers and the like, done by her own hand.

Her wedding trousseau too is a work of love, hand-stitched and embroidered by her mother as a parting gift. ""Needlework is a natural gift every Gujarati girl is blessed with and it is around embroidery that our family lives revolve,"" informs Ramiben Rabari, another artisan in Lakhpat village.

Says Monaben, a coordinator who handles the retail outlet at Banascraft: ""The SEWA women are standing on their own feet, earning money, educating their children... and are far from the fear of unemployment.""

Jomiben of Madhutara village offers a case in point. From a salt pan worker earning barely Rs 10 a day, she has risen to an aagevan (team leader) with SEWA in 12 years, supervising the work of 150 women and earning up to Rs 150 a day.

""I am the sole bread earner in my family,"" she declares, her eyes twinkling in obvious pride. ""I have five children and all of them are going to school. My husband manages the home, be it serving guests or helping our daughters in the kitchen. I just take life easy.""

Jomiben’s proficiency lies in Bharat kaam, kataab kaam and khaap kaam — different types of patchwork and mirror embroidery, distinctive of the region. She has already visited the USA and France to share her skills, as part of community learning workshops, sponsored by the government.

Then there is Rajuba Sodha who specialises in cushion covers and wall-hangings, which are huge hits with the tourist crowds. A swift worker, she informs that she can embroider as many as 200 mirrors a day and earns as much as Jomiben.

""After my husband died eight years ago, we were in deep debts,"" she narrates. ""One by one, my sons left me, moved to towns, got married and did not look back since. That was when SEWA came to my rescue. Not only could I clear my debts, today, I have my own bank account and property in my name.

Significantly, the men folk have been quite encouraging and as Monaben points out, have indirectly contributed towards this silent revolution: ""We are yet to find a case when men have grudged their women turning economically independent or controlling the purse strings.""

The bigger blessing though, is that several embroidery styles which have been nurtured over centuries, would have faded away, if it were not for SEWA’s intervention. For before the organisation stepped in, many fashion designers from Mumbai were getting work done from these artisans, but on their terms.

""They had a corrupting influence,"" recalls Jomiben, describing the embroidery styles and motifs with short-cuts, alien to their sensibilities. ""In the process, our girls were forgetting the art of our ancestors. SEWA gives us a free hand to develop on what we were taught and preserve the tradition every Gujarati takes pride in."" MF","SEWA, or the Self Employed Women’s Association, founded by Ilaben Bhatt in 1972, is a unique organization empowering women artisans in Kutch, Gujarat. With over 530,000 members, SEWA focuses on preserving rich textile traditions, especially hand embroidery. Women members create various products, from bedcovers to garments, using age-old skills. SEWA ensures on-the-spot payments, fostering financial independence. The organization not only economically empowers women but also preserves traditional embroidery styles threatened by external influences. Through SEWA, women artisans revive and pass down cultural traditions, ensuring a sustainable livelihood while celebrating Gujarat’s needlework heritage."

2525ed1bb18e6419969fe16dd8b30113,"[DOC 1] New Delhi: As the covid pandemic swept across the country, Dolo-650 became India's most prescribed drug, selling over 350 crore pills since the outbreak in early 2020. Just as the pandemic was receding in the middle of 2022, Dolo's manufacturer Micro Labs Ltd found itself in the crosshairs of the tax department for allegedly extending freebies worth ₹1,000 crore to doctors to prescribe the pain and fever reliever.

Two years later, the government has decided to sharpen its glare on the marketing practices of pharmaceutical firms amid reports of these companies offering a range of freebies to doctors to promote their medicines.

The department of pharmaceuticals, under the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, has sought expenditure details from these companies on distribution of free samples, and expenses incurred on organising conferences, workshops, training and seminars, as part of a broader initiative to curb unethical marketing practices by drugmakers.

The department of pharmaceuticals has written to drugmakers seeking expenditure details on distribution of free samples, and expenses incurred on organizing conferences and workshops, as part of a broader initiative to curb unethical marketing practices. The particulars must be filed on ongoing basis and mandatorily within two months of every financial year, the department said, in a communication seen by Mint.

In the case of distributing free samples, the department has sought details of month, year, monetary value of the samples, details of recipient and domestic sales revenue of the particular drug. In the case of events, the authorities have asked for details including month, year, total number of events and expenditure incurred.

Queries sent to the department of pharmaceuticals remained unanswered till press time.

A senior executive at Micro Labs, maker of Dolo, said the 2022 matter remains under investigation. “The Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the company and they found out that some amount of money was spent on marketing practices by Micro Labs in the last eight years... We have given all the data to ED and we are supporting them,"" the executive said on the condition of anonymity.

The move comes after several pharmaceutical companies were found to be offering freebies like luxury holiday packages, travel and monetary benefits, among others, to doctors to promote their medicines, prompting the government to notify the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices 2024 in March to ensure that these companies don’t resort to unethical means to promote their medicines.

The code bars drugmakers from offering freebies such as gifts, travel, hospitality and monetary benefits to the doctors for prescribing a particular medicine.

What experts say..

Industry stakeholders have broadly welcomed the government's move.

“IDMA is in favour of adopting ethical practices in all aspects of business. Ethical marketing practices are important and we stand by them. We already have necessary committees in place for the compliance. Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices was there since 2014 and got amended in 2024,"" said Viranchi Shah, president of Mumbai-based Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA).

Dr. R.V. Ashokan, national president of the Indian Medical Association, said that the private body of physicians is in the process of updating the ethics guidelines for doctors.

“We are upgrading the issue of ethics for doctors and guidelines are under preparation. We are also drafting ethical guidelines for hospitals for the first time in India. We will release our ethics document on 2 October this year,"" he added.

Any industry where patient care is involved, they should follow medical ethics and no business should be followed, Dr. Ashokan said.

Dr. Raman Kumar, national president of the Academy of Family Physicians of India, a grouping of 2,500 physicians, said that UCPMP's intent is good, and that promotion of a drug through unethical practices is wrong. However, ""There should be a system where professionals and industry can work together in a transparent way, for example- for research purpose... This regulation is absolutely fine, however, we should learn from the developed economies of the world where they have stringent laws but still they are able to work with the industry,"" Dr. Kumar added.

India's pharmaceutical industry is projected to more than double to $130 billion by 2030, from $50 billion currently. It is expected to reach $65 billion by the end of 2024.

In July, Mint reported that the government had extended the deadline till the end of that month for pharma company bosses to file their legal self-declarations assuring the government that they will not indulge in unethical marketing practices to promote their drugs."," The department of pharmaceuticals has written to drugmakers seeking expenditure details on distribution of free samples, and expenses incurred on organizing conferences and workshops. The move comes after several pharmaceutical companies were found to be offering freebies like luxury holiday packages, travel and monetary benefits to doctors to promote their medicines."

869a2a12f7414de129f5d6c5d1dec7be,"[DOC 1] Zoya Akhtar’s directorial venture Gully Boy starring Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt making good numbers at the box-office. Many people think that Ranveer is the heart whereas Alia is the soul of the film. However, there is one person who is indeed a backbone of Gully Boy who is none other than newcomer Siddhant Chaturvedi, who played the role of MC Sher in the film. Recently in interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Siddhant shared many things about his career, life, upcoming projects and many more. Excerpts from an interview:

How did you transform yourself from your character Prashant Kanaujia in ‘Inside Edge’ to MC Sher in ‘Gully Boy’?


I think this is my job. Zoya and I had discussed about how MC Sher’s character has to be. I needed to gain muscle for the character. I do enjoy transformations. I really love doing something which is fun.

Were you nervous to match up the energy level of Ranveer Singh during the shoot? Of course, I was very nervous. I have always been a fanboy of him. I met him for the first time after watching ‘Padmaavat’ at the screening. I have been his fan since ‘Band Baaja Baaraat’. I remember when I was in college, I used to dance on his song, ‘Ainvayi Ainvayi’. Matching steps with him was a surreal experience. He made me comfortable. He is the real ‘MC Sher’ of my life.

You were doing Charted Accountancy (CA) but choose to act in films. So was acting your first preference in your life? No! It was not. Charted Accountancy was my preference. I come from a middle-class background where we usually don’t have that courage to take the risk. I was doing CA. I hadn’t thought about acting until I was in college. I auditioned for Mithibai College’s drama team and that’s where I gain confidence. But, the actual event that happened was Bombay Times Fresh face, which I won. It gave me an immense amount of confidence to pursue my career into acting field. That was a turning point in my life.

As far as my incomplete CA studies' concern, I will complete it if I get the role of Charted Accountant.


In one of your interviews, you said that you have written 6 raps about your life-changing experiences. If given a chance, would you release your own album in future?

No, I won’t release my album. I might use it in some films. I’m looking forward to use my skill in future.

Zoya Akhtar is known to be one of the most disciplined filmmakers in the industry. So were you nervous before working with her?

Yes, I was! I always looked up to her work. I’ve loved her films. But, I never thought she will direct me. It has happened but feels like a dream till now. I was nervous. She’s a fabulous director and knows how to work with actors. She made me comfortable. She is kind, generous. She knows what she is doing.


After Gully Boy’s release, you have started getting a lot of female attention on social media. So what do you have to say about it? I feel very happy. I’m glad that the ladies of our country like me. I love being loved (Blushes). It’s absolutely amazing. And who wouldn’t like being liked by girls?


What kind of changes do you find in your life after ‘Gully Boy’?

People recognise me now. It feels special when you get recognised for your character. As I said, social media followers have also increased. I feel great about it.

As an actor what kind of roles would you like to do in future?

I haven’t thought about what kind of roles because I want to experiment. I want to something crazy. I like the surprise elements. In the last 6 years of my struggle, I did a lot of preparations for my earlier roles as well. Right from learning bowling for 'Inside Edge' to rap for 'Gully Boy', my journey was quite tough.

Which Bollywood star you admire the most?


Ranveer Singh! Not because I worked with him but he’s inspired me. Even he’s outside, made it so big in the industry. He is not only inspiration to me but for many youths of our country. He’s warm, talented, kind and humble. He is just a legend.

What do you have to say about Pulwama terror attack?

It really saddened me. In fact, it happened on the day of our film’s release. At that time, there was happiness for the film but it made me sad. I feel sad for the families.

Lastly, are you going to be a part of Inside Edge 2? Tell us something about that?

Yes, of course! I’ve shot for it already. So, we’ll be coming up very soon. I’m very excited to see myself in Prashant Kanaujia’s shoes.

","Siddhant Chaturvedi, known for his role as MC Sher in ""Gully Boy,"" shares insights into his career transformation from a CA student to an actor. He discusses his preparation for roles, admiration for co-star Ranveer Singh, and the support from director Zoya Akhtar. Siddhant expresses excitement about the recognition he’s receiving and the female attention on social media. He also reflects on the impact of the Pulwama attack and confirms his participation in ""Inside Edge 2."""

The company has received a Show Cause Notice (SCN) on December 26, 2023 under Section 74(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, Pune Zonal Unit, it said in a regulatory filing.The SCN requires the company to show cause as to why an alleged tax liability of Rs 401.7 crore, along with interest and penalty, for the period from October 29, 2019 to March 31, 2022 should not be demanded from it.“The amount alleged in the SCN is based on the amounts collected by the company as delivery charges from the customers on behalf of the delivery partners during the referred period,” it said.Zomato asserted that it “strongly believes that it is not liable to pay any tax since the delivery charge is collected by the company on behalf of the delivery partners.” “Further, in view of the contractual terms and conditions mutually agreed upon, the delivery partners have provided the delivery services to the customers and not the company. This is also supported by opinions from our external legal and tax advisors,” the filing said.

The company will be filing an appropriate response to the SCN, Zomato added.","Zomato received a Rs 401.7 crore GST liability notice over delivery charges but disputes the claim, stating it collects charges for delivery partners. The notice, issued by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, demands the alleged tax for Oct 2019 to Mar 2022. Zomato argues it isn't liable as it collects charges on behalf of delivery partners who provide services directly to customers.

62e61695f6866e986af5cf8397c10bb3,"[DOC 1] New Delhi : There is no evidence that Aryan Khan, the son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, was part of a larger drugs conspiracy or an international drugs trafficking syndicate, and there were several irregularities in the raid on the yacht Cordelia during which he was arrested, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), has found, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.

Indeed, contrary to the allegations of NCB’s Mumbai unit, some of the key findings of the SIT, shared by officials with HT, are: Aryan Khan was never in possession of drugs hence there was no need to take his phone and check his chats; the chats do not suggest Khan was part of any international syndicate; the raid was not video-recorded as mandated by the NCB manual; and the drugs recovered from multiple accused arrested in the case were shown as single recovery.

To be sure, the SIT probe is not complete and it could be a couple of months before it submits its final report to NCB Director General S N Pradhan. A legal opinion will be taken before the final decision, particularly on the aspect whether Khan can be charged for consumption even though he was not carrying any drugs, said one of the officers.

The SIT probe seems to raise more questions over the raid itself, and the conduct of the agency’s former Mumbai Zonal Unit director Sameer Wankhede.

Wankhede, who has since been repatriated to his parent cadre, has been examined multiple times — both by the SIT and the agency’s vigilance team — to get to the truth in the case.

Wankhede led a team of officers and some witnesses on the night of October 2 last year to raid a cruise ship, Cordelia, at International Cruise Terminal at Green Gate in Mumbai. NCB seized 13 grams of cocaine, five grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of marijuana, 22 pills of MDMA (Ecstasy), and ₹1.33 lakh in cash from cruise vessel.

Significantly, the initial findings of the SIT probe substantiate the observations by Bombay high court, which granted bail to Khan on October 28 last year while saying that “there was no evidence to suggest existence of any conspiracy”, the officials said.

SIT’s review of the Cordelia probe which involved questioning all the arrested people, witnesses, officials at the Mumbai unit who took part in the dramatic raid along with Wankhede, has also revealed that Khan never asked his friend Arbaaz Merchant to bring drugs on the cruise; a fact corroborated by the latter during his questioning.

The procedural lapses are already being looked into in a separate vigilance enquiry being carried by the agency.

From the cruise ship, the agency intercepted 14 people and after hours of interrogation placed Aryan Khan, 24, Arbaaz Merchant, 26, and Munmun Dhamecha, 28, under arrest on the afternoon of October 3. Subsequently, the agency arrested 17 more people in connection with the raid.

Relying on WhatsApp chats, Wankhede’s team claimed the accused were part of a larger conspiracy. It alleged that Aryan Khan was in touch with some foreign drug supplier and the chats referred to “hard drugs” and “bulk quantities”.

However, rejecting NCB’s claims, a single bench of justice Nitin W Sambre of Bombay high court noted that there was no evidence to suggest existence of any conspiracy.

The judge said merely because Aryan Khan and others, including his friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha, were travelling together on the cruise by itself cannot be termed as foundation for a conspiracy.

“After having gone through the WhatsApp chats extracted from Applicant/Accused no. 1’s phone (Aryan’s phone), nothing objectionable could be noticed to suggest that Applicant nos. 1 & 2 (Arbaaz) or all three applicants (Aryan, Arbaaz and Munmun) along with other accused persons in agreement had meeting of minds and had hatched conspiracy,” said the judge.

“There is hardly any positive evidence on record to convince this Court that all the accused persons with common intention agreed to commit unlawful acts,” the judge added.

The court also refused to accept NCB’s contention that both Khan and Merchant told agency officials that they were going to consume the six grams of marijuana.

The high-profile case got shrouded in controversy when a key NCB witness alleged that the agency’s Mumbai zonal chief Sameer Wankhede was part of a ₹25 crore extortion racket targeting Khan .

The witness, Prabhakar Sail, also alleged that he was forced to sign sheets of blank paper, prompting the anti-drug agency to set up an inquiry into Wankhede.","A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has found no evidence linking Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, to a larger drug conspiracy or international trafficking syndicate. The investigation revealed significant irregularities in the NCB raid on the yacht Cordelia, where Khan was arrested. Key findings indicate that Khan was not in possession of drugs, his phone chats did not suggest involvement in any international syndicate, and the raid was not video-recorded as required by NCB guidelines. The SIT's initial findings align with the Bombay High Court's observations that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. The probe also highlighted procedural lapses by the agency, particularly by Sameer Wankhede, the former Mumbai Zonal Unit director. The final SIT report is pending, and legal opinions will be sought before any charges are decided."

I love colours: Kritika Kamra
What is your style quotient?
My style is my attitude! Usually what I wear depends on my mood. Style for me is about my personality – every accessory has to be me.

I vouch for brands when it comes to denims, watches, bags, shoes but for other things, I am ok with anything. In fact, I don’t mind shopping off the streets at all!

Which are the colours you prefer?
I absolutely love colours! From pastel shades to bright colours, I love every shade that is out there. I love teaming different colours – for example, mixing a dull colour with something bright can have quite a funky outfit. White is a good colour for the day, while at night I prefer red or black. Red is my favourite colour as it is perfect for my personality.

Your must-have accessories?
My must-have accessories include a stylish, all-purpose wallet, a nice pair of sunglasses, and the right shoes. Shoes are important because teaming up a simple dress with funky shoes can make the perfect outfit. I am not a watch or bag person and barely use them.

Your idea of party wear?
It depends on the occasion as well as my mood. If I’m going clubbing, I might wear a jumpsuit or a pair of shorts with an oversized jacket. I want to be comfortable so I tend to avoid dresses. However, if it is a formal party then I opt for a nice dress.

Your little experiments in style?
I love Indo-Western fusion dressing. I like to provide an ethnic touch to my look, so many times I wear junk jewellery with my Western outfits. Recently, I picked up some funky stockings as well that I team up with tunics and short dresses. I am a silver freak – I love teaming silver with everything.

Your best fashion buy?
I had bought this nice antique watch in a chain that is worn around the neck in Delhi from a local antique shop. It wasn’t very expensive but the watch is beautiful. It has Roman dials and a map of the world, and though such watches are in trend these days, I bought it a while back and haven’t seen anything like it.

Best fashion trend?
Dungarees, because they are so pratical and comfortable! You can have them in the form of shorts, skirts, pants!

Worst fashion trend?
Embroidered jeans! I really feel embroidery and jeans don’t go together.

What designer item/s are on your fashion wishlist?
A particular pair of Jimmy Choo shoes.

If you had just two minutes to put together the perfect outfit, what would it be?
A basic white or black dress with a jacket and pumps.","Kritika Kamra, known for her vibrant style, emphasizes that her fashion reflects her personality and mood. While she vouches for brands for certain items like denims and watches, she doesn't mind shopping from street vendors for other pieces. She adores colors, from pastels to bright hues, and enjoys mixing and matching to create funky outfits. Red is her favorite color, especially for evening wear.

Her must-have accessories include a stylish wallet, sunglasses, and the right pair of shoes, which she believes can elevate any outfit. Indo-Western fusion dressing is her favorite style, often adding ethnic touches with junk jewelry. Kritika's best fashion buy is an antique watch with Roman dials and a world map motif. She praises dungarees for their practicality but disapproves of embroidered jeans.

On her fashion wishlist is a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes. If she had only two minutes to assemble the perfect outfit, she'd opt for a basic white or black dress paired with a jacket and pumps. Overall, her fashion mantra revolves around comfort, personality, and experimentation."

The actor, who’s played a nurse and a superhero of sorts in his films Remo and Hero, respectively, will now be seen playing a doctor in Doctor and team up with an alien in Ayalaan! The first-look posters of the two films were released yesterday, and show the actor in two different set-ups. Ravikumar, who’s helming the sci-fi fantasyAyalaan, tells us, “This is probably the first time that something like this is being attempted in Tamil cinema.
When I decided to do this film, I actually felt like a street cricketer who’s been asked to play an international match. There’s a lot of production work involved, even between schedules, and that’s why it took us a while to restart shoot.” Mention the alien that features in the film, and the excitement in his voice becomes palpable. “There have been so many films in Hollywood that have shown aliens. Even in Bollywood, there’s Koi... Mil Gaya, which features Jadoo, the alien. I heard that the makers had used prosthetics on an artiste to get him to resemble an alien. But here, it’s all VFX. So, when Sivakarthikeyan is shooting in real-time, he really has no reference to the alien that will be seen on screen. To assist him, we’ve got a small boy to stand in front of him so that he can look at somebody and act. But the challenge will be when we sync this on the VFX screen,” he says, “We watched a few films from a similar genre only to make sure that whatever we’ve written for the film hasn’t appeared elsewhere. Nobody has seen an alien and this is a creature that’s part of our imagination — a huge head, big eyes, elongated ears…. that’s the image we all have. So, we’ve used that imagination to come up with our friendly alien,” he says. Buzz is, Sivakarthikeyan plays a triple role in it. “No, he’s just one person,” Ravikumar retorts, “We are hoping to wrap up the film by April and start our post-production work.”
Meanwhile, Sivakarthikeyan is shooting in Goa for Nelson’s Doctor. “He didn’t undergo any prep to play a doctor,” says producer Kotapadi J Rajesh, “The highlight of the film is that Siva will be surrounded by a battery of characters and not even a single person will look out of place. The team will shoot in Goa till March 3, and after a 10-day schedule in Chennai, it’s a wrap for the film.”","Sivakarthikeyan is embracing diverse roles in his career, transitioning from a nurse to a superhero and now a doctor in ""Doctor,"" while also venturing into sci-fi fantasy with ""Ayalaan,"" where he collaborates with an alien. The director of ""Ayalaan,"" Ravikumar, expresses the unprecedented challenge of introducing an alien solely through VFX without any real-time reference for the actor. Despite rumors of Sivakarthikeyan playing a triple role in ""Ayalaan,"" the director clarifies he portrays a single character. Meanwhile, the actor is currently shooting for ""Doctor"" in Goa, where the film's uniqueness lies in a cohesive ensemble cast.

Chhetri, who grabbed a brace in India’s 2-4 loss in the opening game against Tajikistan on July 7, said that the whole team was working hard to bounce back from the defeat and stressed on the importance of keeping calm.

“We need to learn from all the mistakes in the Tajikistan game and try to rectify them as much as possible. Individually, as well as collectively, we are all working hard on that. The most important thing is to keep calm and put your head down and work,” he said.

“No one else is going to help you, which means we have to pick ourselves up and give a good account of ourselves against DPR Korea to churn out a positive result,” Chhetri said at the match-eve press conference.

He said the team was “enjoying” the new style of play based on possession football introduced by head coach Igor Stimac.

“The majority of our focus is on keeping the ball. There are a lot of movements and players asking for the ball. Of course, at times, we have to put safety first and we cannot be passing in defence all the time needlessly,” said the country’s most capped player.

“Eventually, whether it works or not, only time will tell, but I can say that I am enjoying this style and all the players are enjoying as well. The more we are in sync with the coach, it is better for us and we will back him in all his plans for the team,” he added.

Stimac had stated that the Intercontinental Cup was part of the preparation for the 2022 World Cup qualifiers that begin in September.

With the team having faced Curacao and Thailand previously at the King’s Cup and now playing Tajikistan, DPR Korea and Syria, Chhetri stated that playing such opposition will “make the team stronger”.

“The level of opposition is really good. I don’t remember the last time we played five countries of this quality together. We might lose some and might win some but these are the games you want to target,” the captain said.

“Unless you play these teams, you never know where you stand. We’ll certainly be stronger after these games and they are important if we want to go to the next level.”

Chhetri also said these set of games is crucial for the coach to pick his set of first-choice players for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers.

“The two games in Thailand and three here have been really crucial. We are understanding what the coach wants from us exactly and this tournament is a progression where he is still looking for first 18-23 set of players,” he said.","Indian football captain Sunil Chhetri urged his teammates to learn from their 2-4 defeat against Tajikistan and improve ahead of their must-win Intercontinental Cup match against North Korea. Emphasizing hard work and composure, Chhetri stressed that it's up to the team to bounce back and deliver a strong performance. He highlighted the importance of learning from mistakes both individually and collectively.

Chhetri expressed support for head coach Igor Stimac’s possession-based playing style, stating that the team is enjoying the new approach, which focuses on ball control and movement. He acknowledged that while safety in defense is important, the emphasis on building play from the back is a positive shift. The captain believes that with time and better coordination with the coach, the team will improve further.

He also noted that playing against strong opponents like Curacao, Thailand, Tajikistan, North Korea, and Syria is essential for growth, even if results vary. These matches, he said, are vital preparation for the 2022 World Cup qualifiers starting in September. Chhetri concluded by saying that these games are helping Stimac evaluate and finalize the core squad of 18–23 players for future competitions."

9b3cf79eaa8081647815ec7188325f47,"[DOC 1] Costly import of raw nuts is making a dent in the revenue of cashew exporters as the shipments and prices of cashew kernels dwindle. Cashew nut exports have declined 16% for the ten month period ended January 2013. Last year has seen India export 1,31,760 tonne cashew kernels valued at record Rs 4,390 crore. But this year, the country may fall short of this figure given the sluggish buying trend in the global market, say the exporters. “There has been a drop in purchases from the US and Europe, two main buying regions,” said Anu S Pillai, partner of Anu Cashews, a major exporter. The cashew kernel exports have reached 75,798 tonne, valued at Rs 3,089 crore till January 2013. The drop in value is around 17%. Like it happened last year, high import prices vis-à-vis low export prices are worrying the exporters. Close to 60% of the total raw nut requirement of 14 lakh tonne is imported. Till now, the exporters have been sourcing the nuts from Tanzania, and will turn to West Africa as the season begins there. The raw nuts are available in the range of $900 to $1,000 per tonne. “The current export price in the range of $3.30 to $3.50 a pound is not sufficient to meet the expenses on import,’’ said Pillai. A price above $3.60 is needed to keep pace with the import prices. But as the production in Ivory Coast and Ghana, two major producers of raw nuts, gets active, the raw nut prices may slip. The raw nut imports in January 2013 at 71,610 tonne are almost double the quantity in the same month of the previous year. In the past few years, domestic market has turned out to be lucrative for the processor-exporters as there has been a surge in the sales. But increasing flow of under-invoiced cashew kernels from Vietnam and Brazil has been a setback for them. “The cashew traders abroad under invoice the lots to evade 35% import duty. Such kernels are sold cheaply in the Indian market, adversely affecting the domestic traders,” said P Somarajan, proprietor of Kailas Cashews.","Cashew exporters are facing challenges due to costly imports of raw nuts, impacting both shipments and prices of cashew kernels. Exports have declined by 16% for the ten-month period ending January 2013, with sluggish demand from key markets like the US and Europe contributing to the decline. High import prices compared to export prices are a major concern, with around 60% of the total raw nut requirement being imported, primarily from Tanzania and West Africa. The current export prices are not sufficient to cover the expenses of import, leading to a drop in export value. The situation is exacerbated by the influx of under-invoiced cashew kernels from Vietnam and Brazil, which affects domestic traders in India. Despite challenges, exporters are optimistic about the upcoming season in West Africa, which could potentially alleviate some of the pressure on raw nut prices."

While several teachers' bodies slammed the decision, a pro-Trinamool Congress professors' body said the state should not lag when the same 4+1 formula (four-year UG and one-year PG) is being rolled out in the rest of the country from this academic year.

Mamata said that her government had to follow the Centre’s policy because other states were starting to adopt it.

“Earlier, one could graduate in honours course in three years. However, in the new policy, those pursuing graduation in the ‘pass course’ will need three years to complete while those in the honours course will require four years as suggested by the UGC. There is an advantage. You will require only one year to complete your Masters degree. So the matter remains the same,” said Mamata in a programme felicitating the toppers of board examinations.

Sources in the state administration said the decision to follow the UGC’s suggestion was taken after holding dialogues with all stakeholders and on the recommendation of a state-appointed expert panel which had suggested rolling out a four-year undergraduate course from the 2023-24 academic year.

She was speaking at a programme to facilitate the toppers of the board examinations.

""If other states are accepting it and we do not, then our students will not be able to compete with them (at the national level). That is the reason we had to adapt to it,"" she said.

12e04d43c18559a687aa8a3d607d1dc3,"[DOC 1] Robot food delivery is no longer the stuff of science fiction. But you may not see it in your neighborhood anytime soon.

Hundreds of little robots __ knee-high and able to hold around four large pizzas __ are now navigating college campuses and even some city sidewalks in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere. While robots were being tested in limited numbers before the coronavirus hit, the companies building them say pandemic-related labor shortages and a growing preference for contactless delivery have accelerated their deployment.


“We saw demand for robot usage just go through the ceiling,” said Alastair Westgarth, the CEO of Starship Technologies, which recently completed its 2 millionth delivery. “I think demand was always there, but it was brought forward by the pandemic effect.”

Starship has more than 1,000 robots in its fleet, up from just 250 in 2019. Hundreds more will be deployed soon. They’re delivering food on 20 U.S. campuses; 25 more will be added soon. They’re also operating on sidewalks in Milton Keynes, England; Modesto, California; and the company’s hometown of Tallin, Estonia.

Robot designs vary; some have four wheels and some have six, for example. But generally, they use cameras, sensors, GPS and sometimes laser scanners to navigate sidewalks and even cross streets autonomously. They move around 5 mph.
Remote operators keep tabs on multiple robots at a time but they say they rarely need to hit the brakes or steer around an obstacle. When a robot arrives at its destination, customers type a code into their phones to open the lid and retrieve their food.

The robots have drawbacks that limit their usefulness for now. They’re electric, so they must recharge regularly. They’re slow, and they generally stay within a small, pre-mapped radius.

They’re also inflexible. A customer can’t tell a robot to leave the food outside the door, for example. And some big cities with crowded sidewalks, like New York, Beijing and San Francisco, aren’t welcoming them.


But Bill Ray, an analyst with the consulting firm Gartner, says the robots make a lot of sense on corporate or college campuses, or in newer communities with wide sidewalks.

“In the places where you can deploy it, robot delivery will grow very quickly,” Ray said.

Ray said there have been few reports of problems with the robots, other than an occasional gaggle of kids who surround one and try to confuse it. Starship briefly halted service at the University of Pittsburgh in 2019 after a wheelchair user said a robot blocked her access to a ramp. But the university said deliveries resumed once Starship addressed the issue.

Patrick Sheck, a junior at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, gets deliveries from a Starship robot three or four times a week as he’s leaving class.

""The robot pulls up just in time for me to get some lunch,” Sheck said. Bowling Green and Starship charge $1.99 plus a service fee for each robot delivery.

Rival Kiwibot, with headquarters in Los Angeles and Medellin, Columbia, says it now has 400 robots making deliveries on college campuses and in downtown Miami.

Delivery companies are also jumping into the market. Grubhub recently partnered with Russian robot maker Yandex to deploy 50 robots on the campus of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. Grubhub plans to add more campuses soon, although the company stresses that the service won’t go beyond colleges for now.

U.S. delivery orders jumped 66% in the year ending in June, according to NPD, a data and consulting firm. And delivery demand could remain elevated even after the pandemic eases because customers have gotten used to the convenience.

Ji Hye Kim, chef and managing partner of the Ann Arbor, Michigan, restaurant Miss Kim, relied heavily on robot delivery when her dining room was closed last year. Kim had partnered with a local robot company, Refraction AI, shortly before the pandemic began.

Kim prefers robots to third-party delivery companies like DoorDash, which charge significantly more and sometimes cancel orders if they didn’t have enough drivers. Delivery companies also bundle multiple orders per trip, she said, so food sometimes arrives cold. Robots take just one order at a time.

Kim said the robots also excite customers, who often post videos of their interactions.


“It’s very cute and novel, and it didn’t have to come face to face with people. It was a comfort,” Kim said. Delivery demand has dropped off since her dining room reopened, but robots still deliver around 10 orders per day.

While Kim managed to hang on to her staff throughout the pandemic, other restaurants are struggling to find workers. In a recent survey, 75% of U.S. restaurant owners told the National Restaurant Association that recruiting and retaining employees is their biggest challenge.

That has many restaurants looking to fill the void with robot delivery.

“There is no store in the country right now with enough delivery drivers,” said Dennis Maloney, senior vice president and chief digital officer at Domino’s Pizza.


Domino’s is partnering with Nuro, a California startup whose 6-foot-tall self-driving pods go at a maximum speed of 25 mph on streets, not sidewalks. Nuro is testing grocery and food delivery in Houston, Phoenix and Mountain View, California.

Maloney said it’s not a question of if, but of when, robots will start doing more deliveries. He thinks companies like Domino’s will eventually use a mix of robots and drivers depending on location. Sidewalk robots could work on a military base, for example, while Nuro is ideal for suburbs. Highway driving would be left to human workers.

Maloney said Nuro delivery is more expensive than using human drivers for now, but as the technology scales up and gets more refined, the costs will go down.


For cheaper sidewalk robots __ which cost an estimated $5,000 or less __ it’s even easier to undercut human delivery costs. The average Grubhub driver in Ohio makes $47,650 per year, according to the job site Indeed.com.

But robots don’t always cost delivery jobs. In some cases, they help create them. Before Starship’s robots arrived, Bowling Green didn’t offer delivery from campus dining spots. Since then, it has hired more than 30 people to serve as runners between kitchens and robots, Bowling Green dining spokesman Jon Zachrich said.

Brendan Witcher, a technology analyst with the consulting firm Forrester, says it’s easy to get excited about the Jetsons-like possibility of robot delivery. But ultimately, robots will have to prove they create an advantage in some way.

“It’s possible that we see this emerge into something else,” he said. “But it’s the right time and place for companies considering robots to test them and learn from them and do their own evaluation.”
","Robot food delivery is expanding rapidly, with companies like Starship Technologies and Kiwibot deploying hundreds of robots on college campuses and sidewalks in the U.S., U.K., and elsewhere. Accelerated by pandemic-related labor shortages and a preference for contactless delivery, these robots use cameras, sensors, and GPS to autonomously navigate, delivering food at about 5 mph. While limited by range, speed, and sidewalk congestion in urban areas like New York City, they offer efficient service in college campuses and newer communities. Companies like Grubhub and Domino's are also exploring robot delivery solutions, anticipating sustained demand post-pandemic. Despite challenges, such as occasional operational hiccups and high upfront costs, robots are seen as a promising addition to the delivery landscape, potentially complementing human drivers rather than replacing them."

THREE new criminal laws will come into effect across the country from Monday, bringing widespread changes in India’s criminal justice system and ending colonial-era laws. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam will replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act, respectively. The new laws will bring in a modern justice system, incorporating provisions such as Zero FIR, online registration of police complaints, summonses through electronic modes such as SMS and mandatory videography of crime scenes for all heinous crimes.
 
They have tried to address some of the current social realities and crimes and provide a mechanism to effectively deal with these, keeping in view the ideals enshrined in the Constitution, official sources said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who piloted the laws, said the new laws would give priority to providing justice, unlike the British-era laws that gave primacy to penal action. “These laws are made by Indians, for Indians and by an Indian Parliament and marks the end of colonial criminal justice laws,” he said. Shah said the laws were not just about changing the nomenclature but bringing about a complete overhaul.
 
“Soul, body and spirit” of the new laws is Indian, he said. Justice is an umbrella term that encompasses both the victim and the culprit, the home minister said and added these new laws would ensure political, economic and social justice with an Indian ethos.
 
According to the new laws, judgment in criminal cases has to come within 45 days of completion of trial and charges must be framed within 60 days of first hearing. Statement of rape victims will be recorded by a female police officer in presence of her guardian or relative and medical reports have to come within seven days. Organised crimes and acts of terrorism have been defined, sedition has been replaced with treason and video recording of all search and seizure have been made mandatory. A new chapter on crimes against women and children have been added, buying and selling of any child has been made a heinous crime and there is a provision for death sentence or life imprisonment for gang rape of a minor. The offences against women and children, murder and offences against the State have been given precedence in the new law. Overlapping sections have been merged and simplified and will consist of only 358 sections against 511 in the Indian Penal Code, the sources said. For example, definitions scattered from sections 6 to 52 have been brought under one section. Eighteen sections already stand repealed and four relating to weights and measures are covered under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009.","They have tried to address some of the current social realities and crimes and provide a mechanism to effectively deal with these, keeping in view the ideals enshrined in the Constitution, official sources said.

Munde is seen as a mass leader in Maharashtra and says that he is now working on uniting the opposition parties in the state against the Congress and NCP. Excerpts from an interview with ET. ""I can sense a huge anti-Congress wave. Not just in cities but also in rural areas all over the country. People from every strata of society are unhappy with the governance and angry because they are suffering. Corruption and inflation are the biggest issues. With 48 seats, Maharashtra is one of the key states in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. But people feel that the anti-Congress parties are scattered and unless they unite, Congress and NCP cannot be beaten. We have undertaken an exercise of getting all the anti-Congress forces under one umbrella. We will call it 'Mahayuti' (grand alliance). Once this is achieved, I'm sure we will win. We have already got Republican Party of India (RPI) on board. They feel that the NCP and Congress have cheated them. This will be one very important change since the last elections in the state. We are working on getting others on board too. We are certain that we will form a grand alliance in the state against the Congress and NCP. I'm very clear about this. The only reason I entered the MCA election battle was because there was nobody willing to challenge the monopoly of Sharad Pawar. The situation in Mumbai and Maharashtra is such that there are now only two people who can challenge Pawar in Maharashtra. It's either me or Prithviraj Chavan. Earlier Vilasrao Deshmukh had the strength to do this but he is no more. I decided to contest because I feel that Pawar's monopoly has to be broken. He is controlling too many institutions and not really working for their benefit but only using it for his own benefit. I feel he needs to be challenged otherwise there will be no democracy. The whole game played against me by vested interest groups was full of dirty tricks. According to the MCA constitution, any contestant's credentials can be challenged by another contestant or the secretary of MCA. But in this case, somebody who has represented Sharad Pawar in court earlier has challenged my candidature. The residential address in my passport is of Mumbai, my case is exactly like Vilasrao in terms of residential address. If Vilasrao could contest MCA polls and become President why couldn't I do that? All those who supported Vilasrao were backing me too. You will be surprised to hear this but some clubs in Mumbai where there are large number of Muslim members supported me. It is an indication that Muslims in Mumbai are supporting me and the BJP. I have sent my reply to the Election Commission. It was a figurative remark. I did not mean it literally. A written explanation has been sent and the chapter is closed.""","Gopinath Munde, a senior BJP leader and deputy leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, has announced plans to unite anti-Congress parties in Maharashtra ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

""Chandni Chowk... is a story about 'believing in yourself'. It's an old-fashioned Bollywood masala film in its entirety and I hope people enjoy the two-and-a-half hour spectacle,"" Advani told IANS over phone from Los Angeles in the US.

Co-produced by Ramesh Sippy Entertainment, People Tree Films and Hollwyood-based studio Warner Bros, Chandni Chowk... is about an Indian cook, Sidhu, played by Akshay, who goes to China and is mistaken for a martial arts expert.

Deepika, who plays Akshay's ladylove, will be seen in two different avatars.

Shot extensively across China and Bangkok, the film also stars yesteryears' disco sensation Mithun Chakraborty, Ranvir Shorey and renowned Chinese actor Gordon Liu, who marks his debut in Bollywood with the film.

The story goes like this:

Sidhu is the lowest on the social ladder, cutting vegetables at a roadside food stall in Chandni Chowk in Delhi. Sidhu longs to escape the drudgery of his dreary existence and looks for shortcuts by consulting astrologers, tarot readers, and even fake fakirs.

He believes in anything and everything except himself, despite his father figure Dada's (Mithun) best efforts. His redeeming moment arrives when two strangers from China claim him to be a reincarnation of a war hero and take him to their mystic land.

What follows next is a madcap journey from the by-lanes of Chandni Chowk in Delhi to Shanghai and the Great Wall of China, weaved in with rib-tickling gags, breathtaking stunts, spectacular locations and emotions.

The movie has garnered much media attention for its various firsts like it's the first Indian movie to be shot in China and the first to have more than 1,500 VFX shots. And last but not the least -- Warner Bros have bankrolled a Hindi film for the first time.

The film is also being touted as being based on Akshay's life. However, Advani slams the rumours.

""I would like to clarify that the film is not based on Akshay's life but it only has similarities with his life. Just like Akshay went to Bangkok from Chandni Chowk and worked there in a hotel, the character Sidhu is a cook from Chandni Chowk, who goes to China and is compelled to learn martial arts in order to meet his destiny,"" he said.

Chandni Chowk... boasts of a varied soundtrack by multiple composers like Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy, Kailash Kher, Bappi and Bappa Lahiri.

The soundtrack also includes a rap song sung by Akshay and composed by Punjabi rapper Bohemia. It has already become a rage among youngsters.

Throwing light on the music scene for the film, the director informed: ""We decided to have different music directors to have a different feel about the music of the film. Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy are old friends and they generally don't work with multiple music directors in a project, but I requested them and they agreed.

""Then we requested Bappi Lahiri to do a song and also roped in Kailash to lend a different pitch to the songs. Akshay also suggested that we do a rap song and recommended Bohemia and the response has been tremendous,"" the director said.

Being the first major release of the year, the film is being hugely promoted globally.

It is also the first Indian movie to have multiple international grand premieres in a row at Los Angeles, New York, Toronto and London respectively on Jan 7, 8, 9 and 10 followed by those in Dubai, Bangkok and Delhi.

Akshay had a stupendous record last year in the blockbuster Singh Is Kinng, which totted up a gross of around Rs.1.5 billion worldwide. It looks like the actor is all set to scorch the screens again with Chandni Chowk To China - his first release of the year.
