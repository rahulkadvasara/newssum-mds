5ff16db6a3fbf9e72f02985529ccd2e0,"[DOC 1] An Italian man suffering from frostbite and four other tourists were rescued in the Alaska wilderness after visiting an abandoned bus that has become a lure for adventurers since it was featured in the “Into the Wild” book and movie. Alaska State Troopers say the five Italians were rescued Saturday from a camp they set up after visiting the dilapidated bus on the Stampede Trail near the interior town of Healy.

The rescue was the latest episode involving the bus, first made famous by Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book Into the Wild and then by Sean Penn’s 2007 film of the same name.(Movie still)

The hikers were found 13 miles from the trailhead, Trooper spokesman Tim DeSpain said. He didn’t know how far they were from the bus.

One of the hikers had frostbite to his feet and was transported to Fairbanks for treatment, DeSpain said. The hiker’s injuries are not considered life-threatening. The other four hikers were picked up by friends in Healy.

Rescuers were alerted by the hikers with a satellite-based emergency device that notified the International Emergency Response Coordination Center of a medical emergency, troopers said. That international group then notified rescuers, who reached the site by snowmobile, DeSpain said.

The rescue was the latest episode involving the bus, first made famous by Jon Krakauer’s book published in 1996 and then by Sean Penn’s 2007 film of the same name. Both fueled a lingering mystique about a young idealist, Christopher McCandless, who met his death from starvation in the bus, which is about 10 miles north of the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve. Over the years, some hikers have been rescued and others have died while trying to retrace McCandless’ last steps. In July, a newlywed woman from Belarus died after she was swept away by the Teklanika River while trying to reach the bus with her husband.

In 2013, three German hikers trying to reach the bus were rescued after a river they crossed became impassable because of high, fast-moving water. Families of some of those who died are now behind a proposal before Denali Borough for a feasibility study for construction of a footbridge over the Teklanika.

The idea is in the early stages, and no decision has been made. But borough Mayor Clay Walker said there are several concerns among officials. A footbridge might give people a false sense of security. It could lead to more people trying to reach the bus, and that could lead to more rescues, Walker said.

There are more hazards in the unforgiving wilderness surrounding the bus, as Saturday’s rescue illustrates.

“A footbridge wouldn’t have changed the need for a rescue,” Walker said. As far as he’s concerned, a better solution would be to remove the bus. “The fact that the bus is there raises that attraction level,” he said.","Five Italian tourists were rescued from Alaska’s wilderness after visiting the infamous bus featured in *Into the Wild*. One hiker suffered frostbite and was taken to Fairbanks, while the others were picked up by friends. The group used a satellite emergency device to call for help. The bus, located near Healy on the Stampede Trail, gained fame through Jon Krakauer’s book and Sean Penn’s film about Christopher McCandless, who died there in 1992. The site has attracted adventurers, leading to multiple rescues and fatalities. Officials are debating constructing a footbridge or removing the bus to reduce risks and discourage visits.

This included around 1,500 mobile numbers from Panchkula district complainants.The SCB has also prepared a list of all such mobile numbers district-wise and are planning to trace other mobile numbers through IMEI linkage analysis with the help of field units.

But in an early, well-judged interview to Italyâ€™s leading newspaper La Republica, Gandhi has firmly established the rules of the game: No interviews in Italian. No response to ""feelings as an Italian"".

In a remarkable balancing act that Italians are reading as a gentle, if understandable put-down to the country of her birth, Gandhi granted one of her first post-victory interviews to La Republica, Italy''s leading centre-left daily.

With a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi behind her, raved La Republica''s Asia correspondent Raimundo Bultrini, Gandhi conducted a long and earnest conversation â€“ but significantly, in English.

Reported Bultrini, ""she asked that the conversation be in English because after so many years, her Italian is not so good anymore. Gandhi went on to bat aside the first, potentially-loaded question: ""What do you feel as an Italian, a Hindu and the winner of elections?""

The Congress president bluntly replied, First of all, I have no feeling as an Italian. Because I feel Indian. I am Indian"". Despite Gandhi''s careful straddling of the delicate Italian-Indian line, La Republica''s amazing upsurge of emotion and interest was reflected across the country.

Both this paper and the more moderate Corriera della sierra front-paged Gandhi''s win with the lyrical headline ""An Italian triumph in India"".

La Republica sympathetically highlighted Gandhi''s defiance against ""attacks on me (Sonia) because for Indians, I am one of them"".

And in a flush of emotion it deputed a reporter to visit Gandhi''s home village of Orbassanolan, near Turin, only to report that this Piedmontese region of Italy feels a mix of ""pride and fear for Sonia''s life"".

In possibly an exclusive interview, the paper quotes Sonia''s niece, Aruna Vinci to say ""My aunt is an exceptional woman. Not many would have stayed in India after all that happened to her family and kept believing in the same mission. But she did and the Indians understood that and gave her a prize for that"".

Meanwhile, La Stampa, published out of Turin, just down the road from Sonia''s childhood home, the via Bellini, asked the key question: ""Who is Sonia Maino destined to guide the greatest democracy of the world?""

Offering a brief potted guide to the life and times of Sonia''s builder father, Stefano Eugene Maino, it concludes with the news that Orbassano''s mayor Carl Browns is desperately searching for an address to send a congratulatory telegram to the region''s most famous daughter.

""Kind Mrs. Sonia Maino Gandhi, we are much happy by your election and hope that soon you can return to visit your city d''origine"", the paper quotes Browns to say.","Sonia Gandhi's ascension to power in India has captured Italy's attention, but she's made it clear in an interview with La Republica that she identifies as Indian, declining to engage with her Italian roots or feelings.

1be8e64285fb18614bb58ae7ef236526,"[DOC 1] Kalaburagi: Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge has strongly criticised the Union government for flooding the Indian market with cheap, low-quality tur dal imports, alleging that the move has severely undermined domestic farmers, particularly those in Karnataka. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kharge accused the Modi-led government of neglecting the country’s agrarian economy and abandoning the promise of doubling farmers’ income. He took aim at BJP leaders from Karnataka, especially Union Ministers, for remaining silent on the issue and failing to safeguard the interests of their own state’s farmers. “A decade ago, the BJP came to power with grand promises of doubling farmers’ incomes and building an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Today, those promises lie in ruins,” Kharge said. “BJP’s Union Ministers from Karnataka appear more focused on peddling hate than standing up for the rightful interests of the state they represent.” Karnataka is the largest tur dal-producing state in India, contributing over 40 percent of national output, with Kalaburagi district alone producing the majority of the state's yield. The region is known for the GI-tagged Kalaburagi Tur, prized for its quality. Kharge pointed out that in the 2024–25 season, India produced 35 lakh metric tonnes of tur, but the Centre procured less than 10 percent of it. Karnataka alone produced 10 lakh quintals, but farmers were forced to sell at ₹6,000 per quintal—well below the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of ₹7,550—resulting in an estimated loss of ₹1,550 crore. ""This year’s MSP has been raised to ₹8,000, but market prices have crashed to ₹6,250, nearly half of last year’s rates,"" Kharge said. ""Why? Because the Centre is flooding the market with cheap, low-quality tur from abroad, turning its back on our farmers.” He also criticised the Centre’s decision to keep tur imports duty-free since May 2021, a policy extended until March 2026. According to Kharge, over 13 lakh metric tonnes of tur were imported in 2024–25, and the government has signed MoUs to bring in an additional 2 lakh metric tonnes from countries like Mozambique. Kharge cited the Centre's own Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) report, which noted Karnataka had demanded an MSP of ₹16,548, based on a production cost of ₹11,032. However, the Centre fixed the MSP at ₹8,000. Calling the Centre’s import policy “shocking” and “anti-farmer,” Kharge demanded immediate corrective measures to protect the livelihoods of Indian farmers and restore price stability in the market.","Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge has slammed the Union government for importing cheap, low-quality tur dal, which he says has devastated domestic farmers—particularly in Karnataka. Posting on social media platform X, Kharge accused the Modi-led government of abandoning its promises to double farmers’ incomes and build an Atmanirbhar Bharat. He criticized BJP Union Ministers from Karnataka for remaining silent on policies that, he claims, betray their own state’s agricultural community.

Karnataka, the largest tur dal-producing state in India, has seen its farmers suffer severe financial losses. Despite producing 10 lakh quintals in 2024–25, many farmers were forced to sell at ₹6,000 per quintal—well below the MSP of ₹7,550—resulting in an estimated loss of ₹1,550 crore. Though the MSP has been raised to ₹8,000 this year, market prices have dropped to ₹6,250, further compounding the crisis.

Kharge blamed this price crash on the Centre's decision to allow duty-free tur imports since May 2021, recently extended to March 2026. Over 13 lakh metric tonnes of tur were imported in 2024–25, with more on the way from countries like Mozambique. Calling the policy “anti-farmer,” he urged immediate action to restore price stability and protect farmer livelihoods."
cc2473512cb81ec8ed2dc128ccb3063c,"[DOC 1] A federal court jury has decided that Google's Android app store has been protected by anticompetitive barriers that have damaged smartphone consumers and software developers, dealing a blow to a major pillar of a technology empire.
The unanimous verdict reached Monday came after just three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial revolving around a lucrative payment system within Google's Play store. The store is the main place where hundreds of millions of people around the world download and install apps that work on smartphones powered by Google's Android software.Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed a lawsuit against Google three years ago, alleging that the internet search giant has been abusing its power to shield its Play Store from competition in order to protect a gold mine that makes billions of dollars annually. Just as Apple does for its iPhone app store, Google collects a commission ranging from 15 per cent to 30 per cent on digital transactions completed within apps.Apple prevailed in a similar case that Epic brought against the iPhone app store. But that 2021 trial was decided by a federal judge in a ruling that is under appeal at the US Supreme Court.
The nine-person jury in the Play store case apparently saw things through a different lens, even though Google technically allows Android apps to be downloaded from different stores an option that Apple prohibits on the iPhone.
Just before the Play store trial started, Google sought to avoid having a jury determine the outcome, only to have its request rejected by US District Judge James Donato. Now it will be up to Donato to determine what steps Google will have to take to unwind its illegal behaviour in the Play Store. The judge indicated he will hold hearings on the issue during the second week of January.Epic CEO Tim Sweeney broke into a wide grin after the verdict was read and slapped his lawyers on the back and also shook the hand of a Google attorney, whom he thanked for his professional attitude during the proceedings.
""Victory over Google!"" Sweeney wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In a company post, Epic hailed the verdict as ""a win for all app developers and consumers around the world."" Google plans to appeal the verdict, according to a statement from Wilson White, the company's vice president of government affairs and public policy.

""The competition between the app stores is tied to the competition between the phones."" But Bornstein ridiculed the notion of Google and Android competing against Apple and its incompatible iPhone software system. ""Apple is not the get out of jail for free' card that Google wants it to be,"" Bornstein told the jury.
Google also pointed to rival Android app stores such as the one that Samsung installs on its popular smartphones as evidence of a free market. Combined with the rival app stores pre-installed on devices made by other companies, more than 60 per cent of Android phones offer alternative outlets for Android apps.Epic, though, presented evidence asserting the notion that Google welcomes competition as a pretense, citing the hundreds of billions of dollars it has doled out to companies, such as game maker Activision Blizzard, to discourage them from opening rival app stores. Besides making these payments, Bornstein also urged the jury to consider the Google ""scare screens"" that pop up warning consumers of potential security threats when they try to download Android apps from some of the alternatives to the Play Store.
""These are classic anticompetitive strategies used by dominant firms to protect their monopolies,"" Bornstein said.
Google's empire could be further undermined by another major antitrust trial in Washington that will be decided by a federal judge after hearing final arguments in May. That trial has cast a spotlight on Google's cozy relationship with Apple in online search, the technology that turned Google into a household word a few years after two former Stanford University graduate students started the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.

","A federal court jury has ruled that Google's Android app store has been protected by anticompetitive barriers, damaging smartphone consumers and software developers. The verdict came after a four-week trial involving a lucrative payment system within Google's Play store. Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed a lawsuit against Google three years ago, alleging that the internet search giant has been abusing its power to shield its Play Store from competition to protect a gold mine that makes billions of dollars annually. Google collects a commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within apps. The nine-person jury in the Play store case saw things through a different lens, even though Google technically allows Android apps to be downloaded from different stores, an option Apple prohibits on the iPhone. Google plans to appeal the verdict, stating that Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform."

Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh today ruled out financial help to private carriers but indicated relief to some in the form of opening up 49 per cent foreign investment in the cash-strapped sector.

A tough talking minister also advised national carrier Air India to get its act together if it wanted to survive in the long run. “Air India is a public sector unit, so the government has an obligation. However, Air India will have to become competitive. They will have to restructure their costs in line with the industry as a whole because the government cannot keep pouring money into it,” he said.

Private airlines, however, will have to learn to fend for themselves. This was his clear message to Vijay Mallya, ruling out a bailout for either Kingfisher Airlines or any other cash-strapped private carrier hoping for such clemency from the government.

“Kingfisher is a private enterprise and banks can only lend if they are satisfied with the business plan of the company. If the banks feel they can recover their money and make profits, they will lend, otherwise not,” he said when asked if the government was willing to give financial support to the Mallya-promoted airline.

Kingfisher had recently sought Singh’s help, saying that the company would not be able to sustain the present scale of operations it did not get government help soon.

The silver lining for struggling-for-survival airlines is that Ajit Singh is in favour of allowing foreign companies to buy equity in Indian carriers, a demand being pursued mostly by Mallya who feels that FDI would help them raise the much- needed equity. “Yes, I am in favour of 49 per cent FDI,” the Civil Aviation Minister categorically told The Tribune.

The idea to increase the FDI cap from the earlier proposed 26 per cent to 49 per cent was recently mooted by a committee of secretaries. The Group of Ministers (GoM) is likely to discuss the issue in a day or two.

“Finally, the Cabinet will take the decision. The Committee of Secretaries has recommended raising the FDI limit in the sector,” Singh said.

However, apart from Mallya, there are not many takers for the move.

Carriers like Jet Airways and IndiGo feel that FDI above 24 per cent would make them susceptible to hostile takeovers in difficult financial situations. Ajit Singh, however, gave an assurance that there would be enough safeguards to take care of such concerns.

Under the current rules, up to 49 per cent FDI is allowed in aviation companies, but foreign airlines are not allowed to invest. When Vayalar Ravi was in charge, the Civil Aviation Ministry had proposed 24 per cent FDI, a suggestion that was countered by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).","Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh ruled out financial aid to private airlines like Kingfisher, emphasizing that they must become financially viable on their own. He suggested that Air India, as a public sector entity, needed to restructure and become competitive to survive without continuous government funding. Singh supported increasing the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the aviation sector from 26% to 49%, aiming to attract foreign equity to bolster struggling airlines. The move, endorsed by a committee of secretaries, awaits Cabinet approval despite concerns from carriers like Jet Airways and IndiGo about potential hostile takeovers under higher FDI limits."

4b6631a7884e256427a81ff52f8609b6,"[DOC 1] India, a nation with a rich cultural heritage and diverse population, faces a significant challenge in the form of malnutrition, particularly among its children and women. In the last nine years, the government of India has implemented several schemes aimed at addressing this pressing issue. However, despite these efforts, malnutrition remains a critical concern.Rashtriya Poshan Maah 2023 is harnessing the power of Jan Bhagidari through people’s participation under various themes. Diverse activities like Swasth Balak Spardha, Anaemia camps, and Poshan Bhi Padhai Bhi registered a record number of activities just in a day on the Jan Andolan dashboard.Since the launch of POSHAN Abhiyaan in March 2018, the nation has embarked on nationwide Jan Andolans focused on nutrition for the very first time. These annual Jan Andolans under POSHAN Abhiyaan are carefully curated to promote behavioural changes, particularly as regards consumption of essential nutritious foods extending to the grassroots level. They are designed to target specific beneficiaries, namely pregnant women, lactating mothers, adolescent girls, and children up to 6 years of age.

The Jan Andolans is celebrated twice annually, during Poshan Maah in September and Poshan Pakhwada in March-April. To date, 10 Jan Andolans have been successfully celebrated (5 for each Maah and Pakhwada), recording more than 60 crore sensitization activities. This demonstrates the increasing and sustained participation across the country since 2018.

Currently, the nation is observing the 6th Rashtriya Poshan Maah, organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. This event demonstrates the strength of collaboration with various key ministries and departments for maximum outreach. In the first 12 days of these ongoing celebrations, over 6 crore activities have been registered on the Jan Andolan dashboard across the country.

Throughout this month-long event, diverse stakeholders are actively participating to improve ground-level nutrition outcomes and encourage behavioural changes. Ministries such as Rural Development, Health & Family Welfare, and Panchayati Raj are leading, with the Ministry of Rural Development alone recording more than 6 lakh activities under Rashritya Poshan Maah 2023.

The current campaign is focusing on key themes, including exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding, Swasth Balak Spardha, growth measurement, and sensitization of tribal communities to millet, local food, and traditional food for addressing malnutrition challenges like anaemia, among others.

In terms of specific sensitization activities, the Swasth Balak Spardha/Growth measurement drive has registered the highest number of activities at 15 lakhs, followed by sensitization activities on growth monitoring and “Food Resource Mapping” within the village boundaries, which stand at close to 14 lakh activities. Additionally, anaemia camps for children, adolescent girls, and women in tribal districts recorded more than 12 lakh activities, with 11 lakh home visits focusing on ECCE, especially engaging parents.

Collectively, through each Jan Andolan and its unique participatory sensitization activities, steady progress is being made towards making nutrition a part of Jan Bhagidari. Poshan Abhiyaan 2.0 aims at improving the nutritional status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Resting on the pillars of convergence, governance, and capacity building, Poshan 2.0 aims to contribute to the human capital development of the country, address challenges of malnutrition, promote nutrition awareness, develop good eating habits for sustainable health and well-being, and address nutrition-related deficiencies.

Poshan Abhiyaan 2.0 aims to benefit approximately 11.80 crore children studying in 11.20 lakh schools nationwide. This initiative extends mid-day meals to Balvatika children, in addition to those in classes 1 to 8 in government and government-aided schools, aligning with the National Education Policy 2020. The scheme integrates Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and Women Self-Help Groups to champion the “vocal for local” philosophy, advancing the objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat, India’s self-reliance initiative. To ensure the effective implementation of the National Nutrition Mission, social audits are made mandatory for every school in every district, engaging university and college students in field visits to monitor progress. Poshan Abhiyaan promotes the establishment of nutrition gardens in schools to provide additional micronutrients to students. It encourages schools to organise cooking competitions based on locally available vegetables. States are empowered to include supplementary items based on local needs, such as milk, fruits, or vegetables, with central approval, especially in regions with a high prevalence of anemia. Poshan Abhiyaan introduces “Tithi Bhojan,” encouraging students from private schools to share their meals with underprivileged children at least once a month, fostering community participation and empathy.

The Modi government is providing free food grains to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next year. This initiative is set to improve access, affordability, and availability of entitled food grains for approximately 81 crore beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Importantly, it will alleviate the financial burden on the poorest of the poor, removing barriers to their access to nutritious food. The government’s food subsidy expense for the next year under NFSA and other welfare schemes is expected to exceed INR 2 lakh crore ($24.5 billion), underscoring the significance of this commitment. Awareness-generation activities like the “Eat Right India” campaign are implemented to promote healthy eating habits among schoolchildren and the wider community. This campaign emphasises the importance of eating healthy, safe, and sustainable food. In 2019, the Modi government launched the One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme, a citizen-centric and technology-driven initiative aimed at simplifying access to food. This innovative system facilitates the portability of ration cards within and across states, ensuring that families can access their entitled food grains regardless of their location. ONORC has already made strides in enhancing food and nutritional security for priority households.

As the Modi government is in its ninth year in office, the Poshan Abhiyan stands as a testament to its commitment to the well-being of women and children, demonstrating significant progress in the quest for holistic health and nutrition across the nation. The Modi government’s commitment to addressing malnutrition through various schemes is commendable. However, the prevalence of malnutrition persists due to complex factors such as poverty, inadequate access to clean water, changing dietary patterns, and seasonal migrations. To effectively combat malnutrition, it is crucial to continue implementing and enhancing these schemes while simultaneously addressing the root causes of malnutrition. This includes efforts to alleviate poverty, improve sanitation and hygiene, promote healthy eating habits, and support traditional crop cultivation. A holistic approach that combines government initiatives with community involvement is essential to ensuring the health and well-being of India’s children and women.

The Modi government recognizes the vital role nutrition plays in the lives of children and is committed to addressing malnutrition through various schemes and programs. These initiatives not only provide supplementary nutrition but also promote awareness about healthy eating habits and overall well-being. By focusing on the nutritional needs of children and ensuring access to balanced meals, India aims to secure a healthier and brighter future for its young citizens. These initiatives collectively contribute to the government’s efforts to combat malnutrition and promote a culture of good nutrition and healthy living among children across the country.

India’s commitment to these initiatives is not only a testament to its dedication to its citizens but also a significant step towards fulfilling its global commitment under Sustainable Development Goal 2—ensuring zero hunger. This commitment takes on added significance as the world grapples with food insecurity driven by global disruptions.","The article highlights India's ongoing efforts to address malnutrition, particularly among children and women. Despite various schemes and initiatives over the past nine years, malnutrition remains a significant concern.

Free food grain distribution to Antyodaya and priority households under the National Food Security Act is extended, aiming to alleviate financial burdens and ensure access to nutritious food. The Modi government's commitment to holistic health and nutrition is evident, though challenges persist, requiring a continued, holistic approach that addresses root causes. The initiatives align with global goals, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 2—zero hunger."

The expedition began from Kibithu in Anjaw district on 27 January. The duo rode a limited distance of 75 kms, up to Hawai, on day one to acclimatize. They will bicycle all the way to Koteshwar in Gujarat, cutting across seven states, and are likely to cover a distance of 3,800 kms in a little over two weeks, averaging 200 kms per day.

“Our aim is to cycle almost 175-200 kms per day. The rains and high altitude bring their own unique levels of difficulty and make it extremely challenging with cold head winds,” said Mohsin.

“Middle-aged women are too tied up and scared to take up challenges. I hope we are able to encourage them to break their shell and experience the fun of outdoor activities. Even if they set out to walk, jog or cycle, it would be just great,” said Velankar.

When asked how tough it is, Velankar said, “Managing temperature variations in short span is tough. Cycling in mountains in freezing cold to high temperatures in Gujarat will be a challenge. We will have to throw away heavy winter clothing as we cycle into the plains.”

Mohsin added: “It is scary at times when for miles together we don’t see anything on the roads. We are so used to seeing people, vehicles and roadside stalls, but the hilly regions of Arunachal Pradesh are completely deserted.”

 Velankar (45) is a seasoned long distance endurance rider, and holds a PhD in life sciences. She is a mother of two daughters. Mohsin (42) is also an endurance rider. She is a mother of two children, and an architect-interior designer by profession.","Meera Velankar and Tasneem Mohsin, cyclists from Bangalore, are embarking on a 3,800-km expedition across India from east to west.

442ea1177dea3e4e307b90d45c22b478,"[DOC 1] In a far-reaching decision, the Ministry of Health, Medical Council of India and the CBSE have agreed to conduct a common all-India entrance test for admission to all medical colleges across the country from next year.

From 2012, the CBSE will conduct the proposed common medical entrance test for entry to all private and government medical colleges in India (close to 300 colleges of which about 180 are private).

Close to 8 lakh students take UG medical entrance tests annually but at present they sit for different tests, including the All India PMT which the CBSE conducts and various state-level medical entrance tests. The decision now is that the CBSE will hold one test; it has the experience of conducing the largest entrance test in India - AIEEE for engineering entrance which close to 11 lakh students take every year.

A common test will ensure uniformity in UG medical education across states where private colleges are in the practice of charging exorbitant sums for admitting students. This arbitrariness in UG medical admissions has resulted in seats being sold and purchased.

The MCI will prepare the course structure for the test and put it on the website for comments of people, said MCI BOG member DR Purushottam Lal. The decision, he said, came in the wake of the Supreme Court orders to the MCI to go ahead with one test for UG medical admissions to avoid stress to students.

One test will ensure quality students entering medical education because states would be obliged to fill seats in their respective jurisdictions with students who figure in the All-India merit list. They would be free to prefer students from their areas but they won’t be able to compromise on merit.

Earlier Tamil Nadu had opposed the move and secured a stay on it from the High Court. The Health Ministry subsequently asked the MCI to withdraw the common entrance test notification but the Supreme Court told the MCI to go ahead. At the latest meeting which Health Secretary attended, the view was that state governments would be roped in to build a consensus on the matter.","Starting in 2012, the Ministry of Health, Medical Council of India (MCI), and CBSE will implement a common all-India entrance test for admission to all medical colleges, both private and government. The CBSE, which already conducts the large-scale AIEEE for engineering, will oversee this new test. Approximately 8 lakh students take various medical entrance tests annually, but the new unified test aims to ensure uniformity and merit-based admissions, addressing issues of exorbitant fees and arbitrary admissions in private colleges. The MCI will design the test structure, which will be open for public comments. Despite initial opposition from Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court has supported the move, and state governments will be encouraged to build consensus on the matter."
70e409fe030823c2d2180c206bd1291a,"[DOC 1] Ten-year benchmark government bond was the most profitable and liquid security among sovereign bonds in the market and every investor who picked this bond at its maiden auction was guaranteed a gain. But not any more.

Perhaps for the third time in a decade, a newly issued 10-year benchmark government bond is what traders term “out of the money” now. In other words, everyone who fought to get hold of this paper on the May 22 maiden auction, is running a mark-to-market loss currently.

“Most bonds are out of the money right now as yields have risen across the curve. The volatility in global bond markets and with inflation data due, people do not want to make big bets,” said Jayesh Mehta, head of treasury at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.

The 7.72%, 2025 bond settled at a yield of 7.88% on Thursday, 16 basis points above the cut-off yield at which it was issued on May 22. If an investor had bought R100 worth of the bond, he finished Thursday with an mark-to-market loss of R1.09. The bond has been auctioned twice and the floating stock for trading in the market is at R16,000 crore now.

“The market will watch for comments from the Fed because a large part of the pressure is from the global sell-off in bonds,” said NS Venkatesh, the executive director at IDBI Bank.

Bond traders said yields across the curve have risen, owing to the scare on monsoon deficiency and a global bond sell-off that continues, and the 10-year benchmark is no exception. “Long-term bonds have fallen far more than the 10-year benchmark. Portfolios are getting hit across the curve,” said a senior bond trader at a private bank.

Bond yields from the US to Europe have risen to multi-month highs as investors dumped fixed income amid rising oil prices and the imminent rate hike by the Federal Reserve in 2015. Domestic bond yields have mirrored the move in global yields over the last one week.","The newly issued 10-year benchmark government bond, auctioned on May 22, has turned unprofitable for investors, marking a mark-to-market loss due to rising yields across the bond market. The 7.72%, 2025 bond settled at a yield of 7.88%, resulting in a loss for investors who bought it at the maiden auction. Global bond sell-offs, fears of monsoon deficiency, and anticipation of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve have contributed to the rise in bond yields globally and domestically. Traders are cautious amid market volatility and await further developments, especially comments from the Fed. The bond market reflects the impact of these factors, with portfolios experiencing losses across the curve."

46f05265dc193ef7260263efce366752,"[DOC 1] India's healthcare sector is likely to get the maximum attention of the Government in the upcoming Budget to be unveiled on Monday, as it comes in the face of the country braving a once-in-a-century global pandemic, says a survey. 

The Assocham-Primus Partners survey covered more than 550 industry participants, and 39.7 per cent respondents said healthcare would receive the highest priority in terms of resource allocation and policy support in the Budget. 

Manufacturing emerged as the second key sector expected to be in focus, with 14.7 per cent respondents expecting it to receive the Finance Minister's attention, followed by MSMEs (11.4 per cent), real estate (10.7 per cent) and infrastructure (9.6 per cent).

“The Covid-19 pandemic tested the limits of the global healthcare system. While the government's proactive measures and the frontline workers' tireless efforts have helped tide the way, the pandemic has also brought forth the fragility of the healthcare system,"" the survey stated. On measures which can strengthen the healthcare and pharma sector, 67.3 per cent respondents expect the allocation of a fund to modernise existing primary healthcare infrastructure. 

This was followed by an expectation (by 62.9 per cent) that the government should increase investments in creating new primary healthcare infrastructure. With regard to aspirations of individual taxpayers, 79.3 per cent respondents said they would like to see a cut in personal income tax rates, especially in the wake of pressure on their earnings in the pandemic-hit economy.

While corporate tax rates have been reduced, individuals pay taxes at higher rates. Rationalising taxes for the individuals is critical as reducing the tax burden on individuals would enable further spending. According to the survey, this much-needed push to demand would help in creating a multiplier effect in the economy. 

""A significant increase in the public expenditure is inevitable. The pandemic has taught us there are no choices other than large scale public investment in building primary health centres, hospitals at the district, state capital level,"" Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said.

As has been stated in the Economic Survey, there is a strong feeling within the government to raise public expenditure on healthcare three-fold from 1 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent of GDP, he added. ","A recent Assocham-Primus Partners survey indicates that India's healthcare sector is likely to receive the highest priority in the upcoming Budget, driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among 550 industry participants, 39.7% expect healthcare to get the maximum attention in terms of resource allocation and policy support. Manufacturing (14.7%), MSMEs (11.4%), real estate (10.7%), and infrastructure (9.6%) follow.

The pandemic exposed the fragility of the healthcare system, prompting 67.3% of respondents to call for modernization of primary healthcare infrastructure, and 62.9% to seek investments in new facilities. Additionally, 79.3% of respondents advocated for a reduction in personal income tax rates to ease financial strain and boost demand.

Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood emphasized the need for significant public investment in healthcare, echoing the Economic Survey’s suggestion to increase healthcare spending from 1% to 3% of GDP.

e2622b47751928c97eee03f394756446,"[DOC 1] India as the second-largest buyer of gold in the world can play a crucial role in the global economic order as central banks are still buying the precious metal in large quantities, Alok Kumar Choudhary, Managing Director, State Bank of India (SBI), said on Friday.

“We have also seen how India can be the fulcrum in setting up global economic corridor,” he said while addressing the 15th International Gold Economic Forum organised here by ASSOCHAM.


While the gold standard might not be in place anymore, several banks including the RBI continue to hold gold reserves as a staple component of their overall reserves, he added.

“In an interconnected world, economic ties transcend borders and gold’s role as common accepted asset can foster a sense of stability and potentially contribute to a more integrated, co-operative global economic system. Banks as critical stakeholders in the financial ecosystem play an important role in formalising gold to ensure the integrity of the financial system,” Choudhary said.


Addressing the gathering, Dr  C Rangarajan, former Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and former RBI Governor, said: “Gold has been a tangible asset since ancient times, in all cultures and across all periods of history. While held as reserve by central banks, it no longer plays the role of intermediary in circulation. As the second largest consumer of gold, India accounts for one-fourth of the global demand. India’s import of gold was 394 tons in 2000 and 774 tons in 2022 or $135 million. In 2022-23, gold imports accounted for 52.2 per cent of the current account deficit. The current level of import duty on gold is reasonable and is among the lowest.”

 among commodities.”

Somasundaram P R, Regional CEO – India, World Gold Council, said: “Gold is a very good diversifier, it de-risks your portfolio and enables you to take more risk in other financial asset classes. India, as a gold consumer, can also be proud to have HUID technology through which every piece of jewellery hallmarked can be traced to its origins, which is aspirational in other markets.”

Suvanker Sen, Co-Chairman, National Council on Commodity Markets – ASSOCHAM, said: “Consumer behaviour over the years in India has proven that we trust in gold. The various initiatives undertaken by all stakeholders has achieved a lot but a lot more can be done. The growth of the country is closely linked with the rise of gold as an asset. The 25,000 tons of gold that is embedded in our economy is one major driver.”

S C  Aggarwal, Senior Member, Managing Committee – ASSOCHAM, said: “Gold has multiple usage, as an ornament, it is a status symbol and an investment as well. India needs around 800 tons of gold every year necessitating imports which increases our trade deficit.”","Indian gold consumption, a quarter of the global demand, remains a significant economic factor, noted at the 15th International Gold Economic Forum by State Bank of India's Managing Director, Alok Kumar Choudhary. Gold, integral to central bank reserves, plays a role in stabilizing global finance, emphasized by various speakers, recognizing India's substantial gold reliance."

The study, reported in the New Scientist journal, believes it reflects insecurities among men who are not societys ideal height. The much-talked about short man syndrome is a phenomenon where short men compensate for their lack of height by inculcating aggressive tendencies, often associated with Napoleon, Mussolini, Hitler and Attila the Hun. In the study carried out by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, researchers asked men and women how jealous they were in their current relationships. In another similar study, involving 119 male and 230 female students, the participants were quizzed on their reaction if they saw their girlfriend, or boyfriend, flirting with a stranger.   The findings suggested that shorter men were far more likely to say they were jealous than taller ones. Taller men tended to be less jealous, and the tallest men were the least jealous, the Daily Mail quoted the researchers, led by Abraham Buunk, as saying. Among the women, average-sized females were the least jealous - while tall and short women were the most. Instead the findings showed they would be more jealous of taller women possessing masculine features such as physical dominance and social status.   Repeated studies have shown that women rate taller men as more attractive and powerful than shorter ones, while men prefer average women, usually who are a couple of inches shorter than them in height.   The experts said the animal kingdom illustrated this where larger males were likely to win fights and obtain dominance and monopolise access to females. They said in humans height was one of the first noticeable features and was therefore associated with status.","- A study by the University of Groningen suggests shorter men are more likely to be jealous husbands and boyfriends.   - The research proposes that this may reflect insecurities among men who do not meet society's ideal height.   - The study involved asking men and women about their jealousy levels in their current relationships.   - Findings indicated that shorter men were more prone to expressing jealousy compared to taller men.   - Taller men tended to be less jealous, and the tallest men were the least jealous.   - Average-sized women were found to be the least jealous, while tall and short women were more jealous.   - The study also revealed that women would be more jealous of taller women with masculine features like physical dominance and social status.   - Previous studies have shown that women generally prefer taller men as more attractive and powerful, while men prefer average women slightly shorter than them.   - The researchers suggest that this behavior is influenced by evolutionary factors, where larger males are often dominant and have better access to females.   - Height is a noticeable feature associated with status, influencing perceptions and reactions in relationships."

One of the potent charges against the previous UPA government was its inability to break the legislative logjam, and the BJP, which was then in the Opposition, had milked it the most on the campaign trail.
The official amendments to the land bill, brought under pressure from the allies and the RSS, included restricting the width of land for industrial corridors, introducing public hearings for grievance redress and promising the
bare minimum land for public-private-partnership (PPP) projects. (Chart on Page 4)
In the Rajya Sabha, as soon as the minister moved the mines bill, which was passed in the Lok Sabha last week, for consideration, the members of the Congress and the CPM moved a motion to send it to the select committee.
The government passionately argued against the disruptive technique but had to give up after several adjournments through the day as the Opposition wasn't ready to relent. (See Page 4)
Although the government escaped the embarrassment of a defeat, the Opposition agreed to put off voting only when a categorical announcement was made about sending the mining bill to the select committee.
Several Opposition leaders said that the coal, land and insurance bills would get the same treatment. By adopting this tactic, the Opposition is avoiding defeating the bills, which would pave the way for a joint sitting of Parliament. In a joint session, the NDA government will have the upper hand.
","The government secured the passage of the contentious land acquisition bill in the Lok Sabha with a strong majority, despite facing opposition. However, in the Rajya Sabha, the united opposition successfully stalled the progress of a mines and minerals bill by pushing for its referral to a select committee. This demonstration of opposition unity suggests that similar tactics may be employed for other legislation, including the land bill. The government made amendments to the land bill, such as narrowing the scope of industrial corridors and introducing public hearings, in response to pressure from allies and the RSS. Despite the government's efforts to oppose the disruptive tactics in the Rajya Sabha, multiple adjournments occurred, indicating the opposition's determination. While the government avoided defeat, the opposition's strategy aims to delay legislation and prevent a joint sitting of Parliament, where the NDA government would have an advantage."

The BCCI president suffered a mild cardiac arrest on Saturday morning while he was through a routine workout session in the gym at his home, sources said, adding he experienced pain in his hand and back and then passed out for a while before being rushed to a private health facility in south Kolkata where doctors after conducting various tests, including angiogram said he had been suffering from myocardial infarction.

The former India captain would be monitored for the next 48 hours and would be required to remain in hospital for the next 4-5 days when a team of senior doctors would decide whether more angioplasty would be conducted on him or whether he would require a bypass surgery immediately.

Informing that the cricketing legend was stable, Dr Aftab Khan of the hospital where he was being treated said, “Sourav Ganguly has undergone angioplasty. He is stable now. He will be monitored for 48 hours. He is completely conscious. There are two (more) blockages in his heart for which he will be treated. As of now he is stable, we will have a meeting on Monday and then we will decide what needs to be done further, priority is to let him settle down after heart attack. He is risk-free and he is talking as well.”

Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who met him during the visiting hours “his spirit is so high … when I went to see him … before I could ask a question he asked me as to how I was … I wonder how a youngster like him can get a heart attack… I could also know after speaking to him that he would never get any test done.”

Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar with whom Banerjee met a few days ago at the

Raj Bhavan --- giving rise to speculations that the BJP wanted him as its Chief Ministerial candidate in Bengal elections --- said, “I was apprehensive before meeting him. But after seeing him in a cheerful mood I have no doubt that our Dada will recover soon. I am relieved like millions of his followers to see him in his usual cheerful mood.”

Earlier Home Minister Amit Shah too enquired about his health following which Bengal observer for the BJP Kailash Vijayvargiya called up the hospital authorities to get his information.

Cardiologist who had earlier treated his father said the disease Ganguly was suffering from could have a hereditary history adding however there could be other reasons too which are related to lifestyle.

“Normally such things should not happen to a player living under such regulated regime … however hereditary issues --- like ischmeic heart or lifestyle can cause such attacks … he might have been under strain in the past few months,” a doctor refusing to give his name said.

Meanwhile India captain Virat Kohli, who is currently on paternity leave, his former colleagues Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Mohammad Kaif, BCCI secretary Jay Shah, woman cricketer Mithali Raj and many stars from Indian cricket and other arena wished for his speedy recovery.","Sourav Ganguly, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), underwent angioplasty after suffering a mild heart attack. Doctors reported a 90% blockage in the right artery and 70% blockage in the other two arteries. Ganguly is stable and conscious, and he will be monitored for the next 48 hours. The decision regarding further treatment, including additional angioplasty or bypass surgery, will be made in a meeting on Monday. Many cricket stars and political figures, including Virat Kohli and Mamata Banerjee, have expressed wishes for Ganguly's speedy recovery."

Earlier in the day, the PM addressed two rallies in Jharkhand’s Palamu and Lohardaga and later in the evening, he held a roadshow in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur, where he continued his attack on the Opposition over corruption, votebank politics and ""attempts to change the Constitution for providing reservations to Muslims"".  against Bhojshala ASI survey Addressing his third rally of the day in Bihar’s Darbhanga, Modi raked up the 2002 Godhra train arson issue and accused Lalu Prasad of trying to “save” those responsible for burning alive more than 60 kar sevaks. “It is because of this appeasement politics that the father of Bihar's shehzada (allusion to Tejashwi Yadav) had tried to save those who were responsible for the Godhra train burning incident,"" said Modi, adding that “after all, it was the rule of Sonia madam.” Also Read - Bhujbal meets Sharad Pawar, urges him to take stand on Maratha quota issue “He (Lalu Prasad Yadav), who has himself been convicted (in fodder scam cases), was railway minister. He set up an inquiry committee and got a report, which exonerated those guilty of the horrendous crime. But the court threw the report away,"" said Modi. Kicking off his gruelling campaign schedule for the day from Palamu, Jharkhand, the PM took a dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi without naming him and said Pakistan wanted him as the Prime Minister, but India wants “a strong country with a strong government”. Also Read - SC bench to hear money bills plea ""Maa Bharati's disrespect won't be tolerated anymore.

But our strong nation wants a strong government and leader,"" Modi said at the rally to campaign for the BJP candidate from Palamu, V.D. Ram. The Prime Minister said that earlier, after any terror attack on the country, the Congress-led governments were ""helpless"". But that has changed under the strong BJP-led government at the Centre. Now, Pakistan is “seeking help from the world to save the nation”. He told the audience that their one vote had contributed to the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya after generations struggled for 500 years, as well as the scrapping of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir. “The Congress and the INDI alliance want to usurp your land. They want to snatch SC, ST and OBCs' quotas to provide reservations to Muslims by altering the Constitution. Till I am alive, I will not now allow any such design of the Congress to succeed,” he asserted. In his address, the Prime Minister claimed that over 25-crore people came out of poverty in the last 10 years of the NDA government. He said: “The Congress never bothered for the welfare of people. The party's shehzada was born with a silver spoon and poses for the camera when he visits the house of the poor. But it is my commitment to transform India…There has been no blot of corruption on me in the past 25 years as Chief Minister and Prime Minister. I don't own a home or even a bicycle... The corrupt JMM and the Congress leaders have amassed huge wealth for their children.” In Sisai, Lohardaga, Modi said the NDA government has “unmasked” corrupt forces and all those who indulged in corruption will face action under law in the next five years. Hitting out at jailed former Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren without taking his name, Modi said: ""The former Jharkhand CM is behind bars for corruption... Modi is committed to wipe out the menace of corruption. In the next five years, all those who indulged in corruption will face legal action,"" he said. “The INDI alliance leaders, neck-deep in corruption, hold rallies, including in Delhi and Ranchi, voicing support for corrupt people, which reveals their true character,” the PM said. Modi also blamed the Congress for the “backwardness” of tribal districts, alleging that food grains used to rot in godowns during the UPA regime from 2004 to 2014, while tribal children died due to starvation. Modi said the NDA government ensured that the poor got access to the internet unlike the Congress, which was “against” it. “Today's youths are the heroes of social media. The Congress had made the internet a thing for the rich, but Modi ensured it became available for the poor. We made mobile data affordable for all,"" he said. The PM also slammed the Congress for not taking any action against Maoists “to preserve the party's votebank”. He said: “But, as long as Modi is alive, no one will be allowed to put tribal lives at risk.” Modi also accused the Opposition parties of “trying to rob” SC, ST, OBC and tribals of reservations because of the “disillusionment” these deprived sections feel towards the INDIA bloc. “The INDI alliance is trying to divert reservations to Muslims. They are going against the views of Babasaheb Ambedkar and first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, neither of whom was in favour of reservations on religious lines,"" Modi claimed. He also slammed Tejashwi Yadav for bringing up the ""Hindu Muslim narrative"" at rallies while talking about the Agnipath scheme” and said, “When we talk about the martyrdom of Captain Hameed, do we think of him as a Muslim?” Without referring to Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav by their names, he said, ""There is a shehzada in Delhi and one in Patna, both of whom think of the country as their jaagir (fiefdom)."" He added: “Their mindset was exposed when they raised questions about the surgical strikes and spoke ill of the armed forces."" A large crowd cheered for the Prime Minister at the Kanpur roadshow in Uttar Pradesh. Mr Modi visited the Gumati Gurdwara before starting his roadshow in support of the BJP's candidates for the Kanpur and Akbarpur Lok Sabha seats.

On Monday, officials reported that Lufthansa flight LH752, en route from Frankfurt to Hyderabad, had to return to Germany following a bomb threat. In response, a threat assessment committee was convened in accordance with Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). Sources revealed that the Hyderabad-bound flight departed Frankfurt on June 15 and was scheduled to arrive early the following morning. However, at 6:01 PM IST on June 15, Hyderabad airport received an email warning of a potential bomb threat targeting the flight. Acting out of an abundance of caution, authorities advised the aircraft to turn back.

""A bomb threat assessment committee was activated, and all protocols were followed per SOP. For safety reasons, the airline was instructed to return to Frankfurt or divert to the nearest suitable airport,"" an official source stated.

Lufthansa later informed ANI that the flight was unable to secure landing clearance in Hyderabad, prompting the decision to return to its origin.

A Lufthansa spokesperson confirmed the diversion, citing safety concerns: ""Out of an abundance of caution, Lufthansa flight LH752 from Frankfurt to Hyderabad returned after authorities were alerted to a bomb threat posted on social media. Passenger and crew safety is Lufthansa’s highest priority."" The spokesperson added that affected passengers were accommodated in Frankfurt and would continue their journey to Hyderabad later. Hyderabad airport authorities noted that the flight had not yet entered Indian airspace when the threat was received, allowing for the diversion.

An investigation into the incident is currently ongoing.

This follows a similar case on June 13, when Air India flight AI 379 from Phuket to Delhi received a bomb threat mid-flight.

36ca6e3d6831ab88ce7effc018cd62e3,"[DOC 1] Chennai: Not yielding to political threats and bribery attempts, a
group of residents from Kottivakkam has managed to retrieve a
children's play area, at the end of a long legal battle. A public park
constructed on this premises was opened to the public without
much fanfare on Thursday last.
For more than four decades, public land, worth at least 6 crore
today (measuring four grounds; 1 ground = 2,400 sq ft), was put to
commercial use by a man named Sonny George. Since 1968, he
has refused to earmark two of the total 40 residential plots for
public purposes.
He had leased it out to a food processing centre which dealt with
chicken exports. “Since foul smell started to emanate from the spot and caused other serious health hazards, we
complained about it to the local authorities but no action was taken,” said professor D Ranganayakulu, president
of Vaidehi Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, who later filed a case in Madras high court in 2011.
State agencies told the court that George was at fault and directed him to execute a gift deed in favour of the
local authority conveying the open space to be used as a children's play area. However, George refused and
argued that it was an unapproved layout and there was no mandate on his part to retain any plots for public
purpose. Condemning this, the court ordered the govt in 2018 to remove all obstructions within two weeks. Six years down the line, the corporation has built a park on this piece of land. “We had to withstand a series of
threats and bribe attempts from various quarters to get the job done. Seeing children today playing at the park,
we feel it is worth the struggle,” said Ranganayakulu.","Residents of Kottivakkam in Chennai successfully reclaimed public land that had been misused for commercial purposes for over four decades. Despite facing political threats and bribery attempts, they persisted in their legal battle. The land, valued at around 6 crore rupees today, was leased out for a food processing center, causing health hazards. After a prolonged legal process, the Madras High Court directed the owner to hand over the land for a children's play area. Despite resistance, the park was finally constructed by the corporation, bringing an end to the residents' struggle.

Travelling across the US as the winter Olympics in Sochi commenced, one was saddened to witness how India’s international credibility had been shaken, when television audiences across the world saw three forlorn Indian athletes marching without a national flag. India faced this disgrace thanks to the avariciousness and nepotism of an internationally disgraced Indian Olympic Association. Sadly, this was accompanied by charges of corruption, nepotism, match fixing and worse involving the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Many Indian friends in the US asked in anguish: “Is there no section of national life left in India which is free from corruption and venalityIJ”

The mood in Washington, where one had occasion to meet a wide cross-section of senior officials, business executives, analysts and scholars, was quite different. In marked contrast to earlier years, I found widespread criticism of the conduct of foreign and security policies by President Barack Obama. The Administration had not only botched up its healthcare programme, but was seen as indecisive and weak in dealing with challenges in West Asia, Afghanistan and the provocations of a jingoistic and militaristic China. President Obama, in turn, is acutely conscious of the mood in the country, which wants an end to foreign military entanglements.

More significantly, as the US moves towards becoming a net exporter of energy, thanks to expanding production of shale gas and oil, the country’s geopolitics are set for profound changes. Using its leadership in areas of productivity and innovation, the US now appears set to the stage for increasing domination of the world economic order. From across its eastern shores, the US is negotiating a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership with its European allies. Across its western shores in the Pacific, the Americans are negotiating a Transpacific Partnership, with Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam as negotiating partners. While China has informally indicated an interest in joining this partnership, the US will use its influence to ensure that China is not admitted till American political and economic pre-conditions are met.

There is naturally interest in Washington in the forthcoming general election in India. The assessment appears to be that the ruling Congress is headed for a drubbing in the poll. Not many tears will be shed in Washington or elsewhere about this inevitability, as the only questions which well-wishers of India ask are how India landed itself in its present morass of corruption and whether a new dispensation, which may be fractious, will be able to restore India to a high growth path.  Speaking informally, a senior Administration official recalled that President Obama had described the US-India partnership as “one of the defining partnerships of the world”. The official noted that “every meaningful partnership between powerful nations encounters setbacks”, adding that such setbacks should be minor compared to the benefits of the relationship and the magnitude of what the two could accomplish together.

The Khobragade episode was a defining event in India-US relations. The Americans found Indians across the political spectrum united in the view that insults to India’s national dignity would not be acceptable. It is important that in future negotiations by the task force set up to address such issues, India should make it clear that it will not tolerate events like Ms Sonia Gandhi being threatened with prosecution while undergoing medical treatment in New York, or the supercilious attitude adopted towards Mr Narendra Modi, who is a constitutionally-elected Chief Minister. We should not accept a situation where Americans believe that they can behave high-handedly towards our elected politicians because of their domestic lobbies. The US should also be left in no doubt that on such issues, including consular and diplomatic privileges, India will firmly adhere to a policy of strict reciprocity.

The Obama Administration has messed up its relations with Mr Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan, dealing with him in a manner that showed scant regard for his position as the elected head of state of Afghanistan. Worse still, by its actions, the US has clearly given the impression that despite its protestations it was clandestinely dealing, behind Mr Karzai’s back, with the Taliban. While the US-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership speaks of joint determination in eliminating the ‘Al Qaeda and its affiliates’, the US now speaks only of eliminating the Al Qaeda and not is affiliates like the Taliban, the Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, the lashkar-e-Tayyeba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed. There are naturally concerns in Afghanistan that the US, which needs Pakistan’s assistance for withdrawing its military equipment from Afghanistan, will seek to appease them by giving them a less than healthy role in determining the future dispensation in Afghanistan and the role of the Taliban in such a dispensation.

While there is an evident congruence of interests in working with the US, Japan and others in the face of growing Chinese military assertiveness, New Delhi and Tokyo cannot ignore the reality that there have been many flip flops and inconsistencies in the approach of the Obama Administration to China. Moreover, the US is becoming increasingly strident in its economic relations with India on issues ranging from sanctions on sections of our Pharmaceutical industry and our Civil Aviation facilities, while demanding changes in our policies on solar panels and equipment and placing restrictions on the movement of IT personnel. It is, however, not India alone that is the recipient of such measures from the US!

Despite these challenges, India cannot ignore the reality that the US is the pre-eminent power in world. Moreover, it will remain so in coming years, primarily because its innovative and technological strengths are going to be reinforced by its energy surpluses, together with the energy potential of its neighbours like Canada, Mexico and Argentina. It will, moreover, remain the foremost power in the manufacture of high-tech equipment, particularly in defence and aerospace. It is for India to fashion industrial policies to leverage its strengths and potential to secure high levels of investment and partnership in crucial high-tech industries. I was advised in Washington that contracts currently secured with US companies enable us to import 5.8 million metric tonnes per annum of shale gas from the US annually from 1917. According to oil industry sources these contracts alone provides us more gas than we could obtain from the controversial Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline. But, for all this to fructify, the new dispensation in New Delhi will have to replace economic populism and accompanying fiscal irresponsibility, with a quest for accelerated growth.","The article discusses the strained relations between India and the United States, highlighting instances of disrespect towards Indian officials and athletes. It criticizes the Obama administration's foreign policy decisions and emphasizes the need for India to assert itself on the global stage while navigating economic and geopolitical challenges, particularly in relation to China and energy partnerships with the U.S. It calls for a shift towards growth-oriented policies to enhance India's position in high-tech industries."

  ""Har cheez mein PM ko target karne ka matlab hamari samajh mein nahin aa raha hai (I do not understand why this targeting of the Prime Minister on every issue). I am responsible for internal security. They should target me. Prime Minister is an institution… attacking (PM) does not benefit the country,"" he told ETin an exclusive interview.
  Calling for a dialogue to cool down tempers amid growing criticism of the government, Singh said: ""I am ready to discuss everything. I am ready to set aside everything else and sit down a whole day with them. I will welcome them to come and highlight the reasons they feel have given rise to intolerance.""
  When asked if this can be considered as an official invitation for dialogue, the home minister said: ""Yes. Yes. Main taiyar hun. Unse charcha ko main bilkul taiyar hun. Main swagat karunga charcha ki. (I am ready for a discussion with them. I will welcome a discussion with them). They should explain their concerns. And not only that, if they really highlight some concerns, I will welcome their valuable suggestions.""
  While emphasising on ""samvaad"" (dialogue), Singh did wonder aloud like other BJP leaders as to why awards were not returned when bigger communal riots took place under different governments.
  ""Uss samay toh award wapsi ki baatien toh hui nahin (no award returning happened in those times). Lekin phir bhi, yadi unka yah mat hai, toh democracy mein main chahunga ki unke saath charcha honi chahiye (Still, if they feel like that we should have a discussion in democracy),"" Singh told ET.
  The home minister went a step ahead and assured there would be no curb on people’s food or religious preferences under his watch. ""(I want to say) There is no restriction on people’s eating habits. There is no restriction on one’s religious practices.""
  On BJP president Amit Shah’s remark that crackers will be burst in Pakistan if the Mahagathbandhan were to win the 
  elections, Singh said it might just have been an expression of frustration with Pakistan and should not be over-interpreted. ""It should not be interpreted wrongly… we are trying to improve our relations with our neighbour, but Pakistan is not responding the way we expect. Uske kaaran jo mann mein dard hoga uski abhivyakti hai (It is an expression of the hurt over that issue). Yehi tatparya raha hoga (this would have been his intention).
  Singh strongly refuted suggestions that the BJP was trying to communalise the election pitch through such statements, parking the blame on the Grand Alliance leadership for bringing down the standard of campaign language.
  ""I do not have any barometer … but leaders of Grand Alliance must be careful that the decorum is not breached. The level of discourse should not go down."" When asked about BJP leaders crossing the line, Singh quipped: ""This suggestion is for everyone…. but our party trains us to maintain a decorum.""
  The home minister refused to get drawn into any detailed comment on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh but strongly defended any accusation that the Sangh was communal in outlook.
  ""I am a follower of RSS’ ideology….if that ideology was communal or believed in discrimination, it would be reflected in my behaviour.""
  He, however, refused to say much on RSS’ recent concerns on demographic imbalance on the basis of latest census data, a subject that comes under the home ministry.
  ""No body had called me. I cannot comment about RSS’ internal meeting. I am not part of those deliberations.""","Alliance leadership for bringing down the standard of campaign language.

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, which was launched fully on Thursday, is possibly the most important step that India has taken towards achieving sovereign strategic autonomy in many years. Once operational, this indigenous system will significantly reduce India’s dependence on satellite navigation systems (commonly known as SatNav systems) that are run by other countries — primarily the US and its Global Positioning System. America's GPS currently supports India's existing SatNav system, Gagan (GPS-Aided GEO Augmented Navigation). Gagan mostly caters to space scientists and the commercial aviation industry but IRNSS will have a wider user-base and, importantly, will function independently; though, of course, it will still be compatible with the GPS as well as with Russia's Global Navigation Satellite System (known as Glonass). The purpose of a SatNav system is to accurately track the location or positioning of an object. This object can be anything — a vehicle, an individual, a delivery package, a mobile phone or even a bird or an animal fitted with a receiver and transmitter. Today, SatNav systems are integral to a wide variety of activities. Some of them are as basic as the use of the Google Maps application on our phones and some much more complex such as the technology used to navigate our mass transit systems, be they under-ground, on land, over water or in the air. SatNav systems also play an important role in emergency services, disaster management and help with weather forecasting; they are used for geological surveys and mapping activities, in archaeological studies as well as for photographic geo-coding. Increasingly, SatNav systems are also being used for social networking. This list can go on but it should suffice to say that SatNav systems underline just about every activity in our daily lives and, given that this trend will only grow stronger in the days to come, it is the fitness of things that India has developed its own SatNav system.","India has successfully launched its fully operational Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), reducing the country's reliance on other countries' satellite navigation systems. IRNSS, known as NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), aims to provide accurate position information to users in India and the surrounding region. This move enhances India's strategic autonomy and reduces dependence on systems like the US Global Positioning System (GPS). IRNSS is compatible with GPS and Russia's Glonass, providing a wide range of applications from navigation to disaster management and weather forecasting."

98f3331f8f0799333eb9fe1935dad483,"[DOC 1] In a veiled reference to recent developments in Jharkhand, President APJ Abdul Kalam today decried dubious and undemocratic means adopted to cobble up numbers to form governments and called for introspection so that politics did not degrade itself to political adventurism.

Making candid observations over polling processes that have been, of late, under severe strain with fatal violence, the President pleaded with the parliamentarians to embark upon course of “developmental politics” instead of “political politics” which the political parties had been following now.

“The arithmetical compulsions of incremental numbers and the alleged tradability of certain legislative seats, won perhaps through means allegedly dubious and undemocratic, have many a time created doubts on our democratic system in the public eye”, Dr Kalam said.

The President was speaking in the Central Hall of Parliament after giving away the Outstanding Parliamentarian Awards to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Union Minister Arjun Singh, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha L K Advani and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Jaswant Singh.

Dr Kalam said when politics degraded itself to political adventurism; the nation would be on the calamitous road to inevitable disaster and ruination.

He said, “Let us not risk it. It is time all of us did introspection and grew up to the expectations that were enshrined so diligently and optimistically by the founding fathers in our Constitution so that India sustained itself and grew as a mature, healthy, vibrant democratic nation.”

Accepting the award, the Prime Minister regretted the decline in general atmosphere in Parliament and standard of debate and called for introspection before people lose faith in the institution.

Reminding the gathering that people were yearning for lifestyle change and expect Parliamentarians to bring smile on their faces through appropriate policies, laws and facilitating societal transition, the President said, “We seem to have been working with policies and procedures which are at times based on mistrust.”

Seeking to distinguish between ‘political politics’ and ‘developmental politics’, he said the former was needed at the time of independence movement.

Today, the President said, what was needed for India was a mission to make it free from poverty, illiteracy and unemployment and this situation necessitated developmental politics.

Dr Kalam said Parliament needed to launch a mission to identify and scrap complex old laws and those administrative procedures, which hindered growth-oriented development economy.

“This will give scope and a hope to a large section of the people who are honest, to flower and flourish. India must move to a trust-based system and only members of this great Parliament can bring about this change,” the President said.

Presenting a situation in which political parties perform in the environment of developmental politics competing with each other, the President said while one party would promise to make India a developed nation with a growth plan of every five years in 15 years, another would unveil a new strategy to achieve it in a shorter period.

In another scenario, he expected parties to ensure all border conflicts were resolved in 10 years while another would promise to create harmonious relationship within a period of five years. Yet another might say, border trade would become meaningless.

Dr Singh said everyone would agree that the increasingly negative public perception of politics as an instrument of social change and those who make it their vocation was partly due to decline in standards.

“Without pointing fingers, we need to examine whether we are living up to the standards set by great parliamentarians of early years of our independence. It is for us to ensure that we set better standards for future,” the Prime Minister said.

Dr Singh said the day the people begin to lose faith in the institution of Parliament would also be the day that this important edifice would come under pressure. “We must not; we must never let this happen.” ","President APJ Abdul Kalam expressed concern over recent developments in Jharkhand and criticized dubious and undemocratic means used to form governments. In a speech at the Central Hall of Parliament, he called for introspection to prevent politics from degrading itself to political adventurism.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, receiving the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award, regretted the decline in the atmosphere in Parliament and called for introspection to restore public faith in the institution."

MRLs are primarily trading standards, but they also help ensure that residue levels do not pose unacceptable risks for consumers.
Recently, the Tea Board had said the export target needs to be raised by 50 per cent by tapping new countries and filling up the vacuum created by crisis-hit Sri Lanka in the global market.
India exported 195.90 million kg of tea in 2021. The major buyers were the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS) nations, such as Russia, and Iran.
The board is aiming at achieving 300 million kg of tea this year.
""Return of Indian export consignments is hardly any"", P K Bezboruah, former Tea Board chairman said.
A senior official of the Tea Board told PTI that complaints have been received from tea packagers and exporters on the issue.
""It is reiterated that producers should strictly abide by the extant norms of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The issue of modification of the norms has been raised by the producer organisations with FSSAI. It is obvious that exports should adhere to the existing norms of the importing countries,"" the official said.

f4b347b16bd6584ce89c54ad3fe0eb9e,"[DOC 1] By Shalini JainSenior Manager, Tax & Regulatory Services, Ernst & YoungSavings or investments are important for any economy, since, high levels of savings help the economy progress on a continuous growth path. The investments are mainly financed out of savings of masses. Given the importance of savings, the Government from time-to-time provides various incentives for promoting the domestic household savings. In India, the saving behavior of the people is largely motivated by the tax incentives or benefits attached to any saving instrument. Any instrument of saving/investment scheme has three stages of life, which are (a) Investment stage (b) Accumulation or Earning stage and (c) Withdrawal stage. The Government provides tax incentives or benefits at any or each stage of the saving instrument, depending upon its policy. Pre-Budget: Tax CalculatorPost-Budget: Tax CalculatorAt the investment stage, the tax benefits are provided by giving deduction of the amount saved or invested from the total taxable income of the individual. For example, the amount invested in Public Provident Fund (PPF) account is eligible for deduction from the total taxable income of an individual, subject to certain limits. At the earning stage, the benefits are provided by tax exempting the income earned on the savings or investment. For example, interest earned or accrued to the credit of PPF balance amount is exempt from tax. At the withdrawal stage, the benefits are provided by not taxing the accumulated amount of principal, interest earned and bonus, if any, at the time of maturity or withdrawal of the saving instrument or investment. For example, the amount withdrawn from PPF account on maturity is not taxable. Therefore, PPF is out of the tax net throughout its life cycle viz. investment, earning and withdrawal and is exempt-exempt-exempt (popularly known as EEE) at each stage. It is pertinent to note here that the Government may, according to its tax policy, tax any instrument of investment or saving at any stage i.e. either at investment, earning or at withdrawal stage. If any savings instrument is taxed at the withdrawal stage, it falls under the EET (i.e. Exempt- Exempt- Tax) scheme of taxation. In other words, under the EET regime, saving instruments are taxed neither at investment stage nor at earning stage but are taxed at the withdrawal stage. Therefore, every instrument of savings can be classified under permutation-combinations of EEE, EET, ETE, TEE, TTE or ETT according to the stage of taxability. Going forward, the Government is planning to rationalise the domestic savings environment by introducing the tax provisions for specified savings instruments, which are currently under EEE regime and hence, is proposing to tax the savings instruments at least at one stage, i.e. either at earning stage or at withdrawal stage. As discussed above, the tax policy of the country hugely affects the saving decision of the people. The transition of savings instruments from EEE regime to EET regime would have a significant impact on the saving behavior of population at large. It would change the investment choice and preference amongst the taxpayers. Under EET regime, the amount invested including interest, dividend, bonus, capital appreciation or any other form of return by whatever name called will be subject to tax at the time of actual receipt. The amount of withdrawal from long-term savings instruments likes Employee Provident Fund (EPF), PPF, Government Provident Fund (GPF) and so on which are currently out of tax net, will become taxable. The major impact of shift in taxation from EEE regime to EET regime will be on long term investment planning of the individual. From social security point of view, this will result in huge financial hit on the funds of the retiring population of the country who have invested their fortune in long term investment funds under EEE regime. Considering the savings and investments environment of the country, it would be better, if the new regime of EET is introduced for new investments and savings made on or after the introduction of new EET regime. This would also enable the institutions in prescribing the new regime in more efficient manner. If the existing savings and investments instruments are taxed prospectively from the day EET taxation is introduced, there may be difficulty in distinguishing the investment and accumulations under EEE regime and EET regime, in allocation of incomes accruing in respect of old contributions/accumulations and fresh investments/deposits, the manner of treating the withdrawals viz. whether on FIFO or LIFO basis to be adopted for identifying the withdrawals made out of investments/deposits. Therefore, there is a need for due caution to be exercised, while deciding the modalities of introducing the EET regime of taxation, so that the financial well being of the investors of this country is maintained. (Views expressed are personal)Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy","The government is planning to change the tax policy for savings instruments from EEE (exempt-exempt-exempt) to EET (exempt-exempt-tax). This will have a significant impact on the saving behavior of the population and the financial well-being of investors.

1424e1363a55e5293d2bdbff193f5607,"[DOC 1] Stereotyping & objectification of women in the media narrative is a universal truth, that need to be addressed, questioned & reversed, writes Jaishri Jethwaney in her new book. An edited excerpt:

The 1970s saw the rise of trade unionism and advocacy movements for civil liberties, especially after the clamping of emergency by Mrs. Indira Gandhi in 1975. Further, in 1974 a document was prepared on the Status of Women by the official Status of Women Commission, titled ‘Towards Equality.’ It focused attention on the fact that, despite many progressive social legislations and constitutional guarantees, women’s status in India had indeed not improved much, especially in many areas like political, economic and social spheres. This document has been the basis for many legislations and development programs focusing on gender as well as creation of women’s organizations and working groups — as discussed later. The United Nations declared 1975 as the International Year for women and 8 March as the International Day for Women.

The last 70+ years of independence has seen many organizations springing up that have espoused the cause of women, both in the cities and at grassroots level. Domestic violence, alcoholism, female feticide, sexual harassment of women at work place, skewed and unjust family laws, reproductive rights, legislative reforms are some of the issues spearheaded by civil society organizations and NGOs. On the academic front, many universities in the 1970s set up Women Studies’ centres.

A pioneer in Women’s studies, Dr. Vina Mazumdar was the first one in the independent India to combine activism with scholarly research in women’s studies.

Vina Mazumdar [1994] argues that women became a point of engagement in politics as well as research and academia during the colonial rule with an objective to justify both social reform or to give a backbone for India’s cultural pride. She writes that this however, became redundant in post-independent India, as the need for justification was no longer necessary. This may have in some way led to the side-lining of women’s issue and with that the increase in gender disparity between men and women. This gap was highlighted in the investigation by the Committee on the Status of Women in India and the subsequent report ‘Towards Equality’ 1975. With this, a new agenda was set to change the status of women and for that research on women’s issue was one area, which received the impetus. A new program for Women’s Studies, initiated by the ICSSR began which, over the years has seen a lot of seminal work in this arena. This went along with several other processes of bringing about change and empowerment as the larger women’s movement also went along. Critics however, feel that in the beginning, there was a lot of academia — civil society interface, which over the years, has eroded.

Many UN organizations like the UNICEF, UNFPO and UNESCO have also entered the policy dialogue with the government based on milestones articulated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) of which India is a signatory.

Equal Rights and Opportunities Guaranteed by Constitution of India

The Constitution of India provides equal status and opportunities to women along with men. The Indian women received equal political rights for which their western counterparts had to fight a long battle.

Women-Centric Laws

Since the country’s independence in 1947, many laws have been passed to address the issues of equal opportunities for women at work place and home to address issues of sexual harassment at work place, domestic violence, dowry, and female infanticide, and feticide, property rights among others. Discrimination, however, is so well entrenched in the patriarchal mind-set of the society coupled with ignorance and centuries of subjugation that both the urban and the rural women endure (particularly the latter as they suffer in larger measure in every possible way) when it comes to equality. Women, especially in the rural arena are raped and wronged to settle caste rivalries. Young women choosing to wed out of caste and religion often become victims of honour killing. Who they can marry, what they would wear, how they would behave are sometime issues discussed in the illegal Khap panchayats, while the state administration is often seen as a mute spectator.

The passing of the two acts viz. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prohibition), 2013, and the Indecent Portrayal of Women in Media (Prohibition), 1986, together with many other acts including against those against domestic violence, dowry, and sex determination as well as the setting up of the National Commission for Women (NCW) at the centre and other state level commissions are pointers to the efforts by myriad women rights organizations in influencing policy and also various governments in addressing women issues.

Having said that, there is no gain saying that there are laws in place but it is the implementation, which is more often lax. Social transformation accompanied with implementation of laws shall be the key to address women related issues in India. The feminist literature and movements bear testimony to the fact that feminism is very much home grown and organic in India and not a copy of the West as generally alleged. The feminist movement is not against men but about fighting the power structures that are so well embedded in the familial, social, political and economic spheres.","The article discusses the stereotyping and objectification of women in the media narrative, highlighting the need to address, question, and reverse these trends. The author, Jaishri Jethwaney, notes that the 1970s saw the rise of trade unionism and advocacy movements for civil liberties, including the Status of Women Commission's report ""Towards Equality"" in 1975. This document highlighted the lack of improvement in women's status in India despite progressive social legislations and constitutional guarantees.
The article also discusses the growth of women's studies centers in universities and the work of pioneers like Dr. Vina Mazumdar, who combined activism with scholarly research. The author argues that the need to justify women's issues in colonial India led to their sidelining in post-independent India, resulting in increased gender disparity.
The article highlights the importance of equal rights and opportunities guaranteed by the Constitution of India and the various laws passed to address women's issues, such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, and property rights. However, it also notes that discrimination and ignorance are deeply entrenched in the patriarchal mindset, leading to continued subjugation of women, particularly in rural areas.
The author concludes that social transformation accompanied by the implementation of laws is key to addressing women-related issues in India. The feminist movement is not against men but about fighting power structures embedded in familial, social, political, and economic spheres."

Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, traditionally London-based, have a personal fortune estimated at £6 billion. Like their brothers Prakash and Ashok, they are the descendants of Parmanand Hinduja who created the family fortune by founding an astute trading business between India and Iran.

Although surrounded by a tightly knit group of loyal friends, Srichand and Gopichand have in recent years kept a low profile, ever since it was revealed in 2001 that former Labour minister Peter Mandelson had contacted the Home Office to inquire about one of the brother's application for British citizenship.

The British media's focus on their lives intensified after it subsequently turned out that another Labour minister, Keith Vaz, had made even more energetic inquiries about their passport applications. Questions were also raised about why the Hinduja Foundation had made payments to a company run by Vaz's wife.

Elizabeth Filkin, the UK's Parliamentary commissioner for Standards at the time, conceded that the money had been given for legal advice on immigration issues and that Vaz himself had gained no direct financial benefit, but she was critical of the secrecy surrounding the Vaz-Hinduja connection. She said at the time: ""It is clear to me there has been deliberate collusion over many months between Vaz and his wife to conceal this fact and to prevent me from obtaining accurate information about his possible financial relationship with the Hinduja family"".

These and other related issues now seem to belong to another age as the Hinduja brothers prepare to move into their four renovated properties on Carlton House Terrace, designed by John Nash and commissioned by King George IV in 1820, where they will be neighbours of the British Foreign Secretary and the Foreign Press Club.

Their new London residence is the Delhi equivalent of moving into a refurbished property on Tughlaq Road or Aurangzeb Road. They are said to have paid some £60 million for the property, which is more than what Lakshmi Mittal, Britain's richest man and also an Indian, paid for his home in Kensington Palace Gardens in another part of London.

At their new home, the Hindujas will be a stone's throw from Trafalgar Square and a short walk from Buckingham Palace. A swimming pool and private cinema are part of the palatial new home which is made up of some 50 rooms over six floors.

But there are other luxurious touches as well, including marble floors, gold leaf and elephant motifs, which prompted a director of English Heritage to comment: ""I can't think of another domestic restoration project on this scale with buildings of this importance. Rarely have we seen such opulence allied to such craftsmanship and design."" ","Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, wealthy London-based brothers with a fortune estimated at £6 billion, are set to re-enter British high society with the completion of their £100 million home in central London.

Now residing in John Nash-designed properties on Carlton House Terrace, near prominent London landmarks, their new residence boasts luxurious features like marble floors, gold leaf accents, and a private cinema. This restoration project is noted for its opulence and craftsmanship, marking their return to a prestigious neighborhood alongside notable figures like the British Foreign Secretary."

""The issue raised by (AIADMK leader) V Maitreyan is indeed very serious. India strongly condemns it. We will definitely summon the High Commissioner of that country and tell him about it,"" External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said in the Rajya Sabha after AIADMK members trooped into the Well demanding a statement from the government.

Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha witnessed two adjournments each as AIADMK members disrupted the proceedings and stormed the Well seeking a statement from the government and raising slogans denouncing the Sri Lankan President.

In the Lower House, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said, ""While matters concerning diplomatic relations are dealt with delicately, this is totally unacceptable and condemnable. There is no hesitation in condemning it.""

He also said he would convey the ""strong feelings"" of the members to Swaraj. But the AIADMK members were not satisfied with the reply and stormed the Well raising slogans like 'Rajapakse down, down' and 'We want justice'.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Rajya Sabha, Maitreyan said the article, which had an objectionable headline and illustration, appearing in the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry website was ""derogatory"" to Jayalalithaa. He asked whether the government would summon the Sri Lankan High Commissioner as this was ""an insult"" of not only the Tamil Nadu Government but also the Union Government.

Jayalalithaa had earlier said the visual rendering on the homepage of the official website just above the link is highly objectionable as it depicted both the Prime Minister of India and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in a very trivialised, derogatory and disrespectful manner.

5378252f714a052d538ff40afee01472,"[DOC 1] An Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of the elite Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police was killed and three others were injured in a gun battle at Sopore town in north Kashmir on Tuesday morning. The militants managed to break the security cordon after the encounter.

Militant outfit Hizbul Mujahideen claimed responsibility and said that its cadres carried out the ambush. Balig-ud-Din, operational spokesman of Hizb, told a local news agency, “Our boys reached back safely,” he said.

The encounter in Sopore, 50 km from here, is the first shootout between militants and security forces this year. Security and political analysts in the region fear that 2014 may be turbulent for J&K as NATO forces are scheduled to leave Afghanistan later this year.

Sources said the SOG team, on an intelligence tip-off about the presence of two militants, including a local Lashker-e-Toiba commander Muzaffar Naikoo alias Muza Molivi, in a house in the dense locality of Chanakan, started sealing the area. On seeing them, militants opened fire on the SOG personnel who were in civvies.

“As the area was being sealed, militants opened fire and hurled a grenade on the party in which four SOG men including ASI Kafeel Ahmed were injured,” said a police officer.

“Ahmed received bullet and splinter wounds in his abdomen and was shifted to a Srinagar hospital where he succumbed to his injures,” he added.

Reinforcements from the Army and CRPF were immediately rushed to the area to tighten the cordon and prevent the militants’ escape. The security forces carried out searches in the area but they could not trace the militants. Sources, however, said that the militants managed to break the cordon after the initial gunfight. The search operation was later called off.

The police said that ASI Ahmed, a resident of the frontier Kupwara district, had been posted in Sopore for the past six years and had received injures at least twice during various encounters. Ahmed is survived by two minor children, wife and an aged mother. Inspector General Police, Kashmir, AG Mir said that the search operation was launched after they received an input about the presence of militants.

“We had an input about the presence of militants and after which a search operation was launched. The militants hurdled grenades and opened fire in which four of our men were injured. One of them achieved martyrdom,” he said.","An Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police's Special Operations Group (SOG) was killed, and three others were injured in a gun battle with militants in Sopore. The Hizbul Mujahideen claimed responsibility, stating their members safely escaped. The encounter began after the SOG team, following an intelligence tip, attempted to seal the area where militants, including a Lashkar-e-Toiba commander, were believed to be hiding. The militants fired and threw grenades, injuring the SOG personnel. Reinforcements from the Army and CRPF were deployed, but the militants managed to escape. ASI Kafeel Ahmed, a veteran of multiple encounters, succumbed to his injuries."

3040e9c5f8d166a45c2af96a5ca6f6a1,"[DOC 1] The aberration that Lionel Messi will end a career without a World Cup will now stay in the realm of fiction. A 36-year-wait ended for Argentina on Sunday night in the most thrilling of finals. And as he walked in front of his team mates in regal robes, kissing the trophy and holding it aloft, no longer would Messi be a step behind Diego Maradona. Doha had brought them level after a tournament where, watched by the world and facing intense pressure, Messi was as inspirational as Maradona was in 1986.

But it wasn’t easy, just as it hadn’t been for Maradona in that 1986 final when Germany had drawn level from 2-0 down.

On Sunday, 2-0 to 2-2 in 97 seconds meant Argentina, who were sauntering to their third World Cup title — and the first since that magical night at Mexico ‘86 — had to do it all over again. So they did through who else but Lionel Messi. When Kylian Mbappe shot France back in contention with that two-goal burst, Messi had to respond. And when he scored again, deep into extra time to seal it for a second time, Mbappe hit back by becoming the first player since Geoff Hurst in 1966 to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final.

In the tie-breaker — in which both Messi and Mbappe scored — the hand of Emiliano Martinez gave Argentina the title for what seemed like the third time in one night.

Cue hugs. Cue song. Cue chants. Cue tears. And Cue Sergio Aguero flying down the stands to envelop Messi. Having cried after scoring and again when France drew level, Angel di Maria, whose goal had fetched Argentina the Copa America in 2021, could now weep in joy.

Sunday seemed a slow day, the build-up to the final usually is. 63 of the games were done and everybody needed to catch their breath before the big one. As it is, the World Cup has throbbed only in parts of Doha, never the whole. All day, areas near the Qatar National Library, the residential blocks in Al Sadd and even the main media centre, usually buzzing with thousands of journalists, looked like it was sleeping in late on a Sunday. Which being Qatar’s National Day, was a holiday.

It changed as you got nearer to the Lusail. By early evening, all roads leading to it were clogged, a coach ferrying media to the stadium got lost and suddenly things began to get hectic. The Lusail, lit and golden, was like a giant beehive to which everyone flocked. In Argentina shirts, in those of France and some waving flags of Qatar too.

The closing ceremony was a “mashup”, in FIFA’s words, of songs we heard through the past 29 days. It was called “A Night To Remember,” but was really a prelude to an unforgettable night.

Everything, from Deepika Padukone and Iker Casillas accompanying the 6.175kg trophy that travels in a designer bag to Messi’s brief hug with Antoine Griezmann, the warm-ups and the lung-bursting rendition of national anthems were that: a prelude to a memorable night.

It was difficult to say who among Messi or Mbappe got the louder cheer when the teams were being announced but there was no doubting that in the 23rd minute.

That was when Martinez could again look at the game after kissing a post and when Lautaro Martinez would fist his appreciation into the substitute’s bench.

That was also when Messi had converted the penalty kick with a placement that sent Hugo Lloris the wrong way. The roar that followed, as Messi found himself at the bottom of a players’ pile, would have reached the moon.

One section of the Lusail bounced like it was on a trampoline. It was the same section, behind Martinez’s goal, that was roaring “Argentina, Argentina” when Di Maria made it 2-0 ending a sweeping move that had Argentina swiftly moving the ball from the right edge of their penalty area to the left edge of France’s. The defending champions, usually so clinical in their approach to games, were being bossed.

Till Didier Deschamps decided to make first-half substitutions getting in Marcus Thuram and Randal Kolo Muani. Like most of Doha, France woke up late but their stirring comeback produced a final for the ages.

Neither deserved to lose, neither did in open play. Say your thank yous in whatever language you want, these two sets of gladiators deserve nothing but our appreciation.","Argentina defeated France in a thrilling World Cup final. Messi scored twice, and Mbappe scored a hat-trick. The match went to extra time and then a penalty shootout, which Argentina won. Argentina's win ends their 36-year wait for a World Cup title and gives Messi his first World Cup trophy."

Particulate pollutants in the air also mingled with the fog to form a sheet of smog that tinted the entire city for large parts of the day, pinching the visibility to 200m and hampering flight schedules once again.

Delhi clocked a 24-hour average AQI of 409 at 4pm, significantly worse than 368 (very poor) a day ago and 333 on Monday.

Still, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) resisted imposing curbs under Stage 3 of the Graded Response Action Plan.

The pollution spike came despite a jump in temperatures. Delhi’s minimum rose from 6.9°C on Tuesday to 8.3°C on Wednesday – a degree above normal. ","On Wednesday, pollution levels in **Delhi** escalated into the ""severe"" category, with the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** reaching **409**, up from **368** the previous day.

Despite a slight increase in night temperatures, from **6.9°C** to **8.3°C**, the **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)** opted against imposing stricter measures under Stage 3 of the **Graded Response Action Plan**. Experts warn that the pollution spike is likely to persist due to unfavorable meteorological conditions and ongoing local emissions."
d391993add37691456065da934300c1b,"[DOC 1] Scientists have found that the years 2001 to 2011 were the warmest in the last thousand years at high elevations of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The scientists also found that the region was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than during the 20th century. The team of scientists led by the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Germany, reconstructed the temperature from a set of ice cores, unprecedented in length and quality, of the past 1,000 years, which revealed that today’s warming in central-north Greenland is surprisingly pronounced. They also measured the melt production rate of the ice sheet, the study said. The Greenland Ice Sheet plays a pivotal part in the global climate system. With enormous amounts of water stored in the ice, about 3 million cubic kilometres, melt and resulting sea-level rise is considered a potential tipping point. For unmitigated global emissions rates, or ‘business as usual’ scenario, the ice sheet is projected to contribute up to 50 centimetres to global mean sea level by 2100, the study published in the journal Nature said. Weather stations along the coast have been recording rising temperatures for many years. In a study now published in the journal Nature, experts from the institute present clear evidence that the effects of global warming have reached the remote, high-elevation areas of central-north Greenland. “The time series we recovered from ice cores now continuously covers more than 1,000 years, from the year 1000 to 2011. This data shows that the warming from 2001 to 2011 clearly differs from natural variations during the past 1,000 years. Although grimly expected in the light of global warming, we were surprised by how evident this difference really was,” said AWI glaciologist Maria Hörhold, lead author of the study. Together with colleagues from AWI and the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, she analysed the isotope composition in shallow ice cores gathered in central-north Greenland during dedicated AWI expeditions, the study said. Previous ice cores obtained at co-located sites starting in the 1990s did not indicate clear warming in central-north Greenland, despite rising global mean temperatures. Part of the reason is substantial natural climate variability in the region, the study said.","A study led by the Alfred Wegener Institute found that the years 2001 to 2011 were the warmest in the last thousand years at high elevations of the Greenland Ice Sheet, with the region being 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than during the 20th century.

Elon Musk's company, xAI, has provided more insight into an upcoming feature for its AI-powered chatbot, Grok, known as ""Unhinged Mode."" The feature, teased last April, is expected to deliver responses that could be deemed objectionable or offensive, as outlined on an updated FAQ page on xAI's website. The mode will be designed to generate content that is similar to an amateur stand-up comedian still finding its voice, according to reports.

The introduction of Unhinged Mode may align with Musk's original vision for Grok. When the chatbot was introduced two years ago, Musk described it as edgy, unfiltered, and willing to answer controversial questions that other AI systems avoid. While Grok has met some of those expectations by producing vulgar content when prompted, it still maintains certain limits. On political subjects, Grok's responses have leaned left, particularly on issues like transgender rights and diversity, according to a [report](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/grok-may-soon-get-an-unhinged-mode/) by Tech Crunch.

08a1879a5e5c94919580f48fb48c5d8b,"[DOC 1] Q3 earnings share: We're now getting some strong numbers for the Q3 quarter. We saw a strong quarter driven by revenues growth for the major mobile products segment, from $1.9 billion to $1.9 billion in the quarter. The growth in the mobile-phone segment was strong. Sales of the desktop segment grew at more than 2 percent, along with the PC segment due to a number of strong business segments. The desktop segment will stay strong as well and will increase in quality in the mobile-business segment.

In Q1, we saw some strong growth in revenue and revenues for third quarter 2015, compared with the same times last year. In Q2, we saw higher revenues and the same year-over-year sales growth for the mobile-telephone segment as we saw in Q1, we believe a combination of business moves and a lot of performance enhancements will help us to maintain our Q2 revenue and revenues. We are pleased around the Q2 quarter as the revenues from third quarter 2015 was much higher than in Q1.

The main driver driving Q2 is the strong growth in our mobile-phone business from the quarter ended June 30, 2015, to the $1.3 billion we see in 2014. In our Q3 quarters, we have been able to capture a high proportion of our mobile-phone customers by adding to our mobile-device share as well. The Mobile-tablet segment added $4.8 billion of revenue to the revenue of the third quarter of 2015, and our smartphone-device share grew well in the quarter to $5.6 billion. The mobile-phone segment now sees a strong quarter driven by significant expansion of our mobile-phone business on both handsets. It continues to deliver revenue on the highest-margin phones and includes the highest-margin tablets. If we add to our mobile-phone business at the same pace as the growth of our tablet business, we will see higher sales and further increase in our mobile-device share.

As our main drivers for growth are the growth in our tablet business in Japan, we expect that both sales growth and Q3 earnings are strong for the quarter. In Q3 quarters, we sold more tablet units in Japan than we ever did before. We did see a few high-end devices in the quarter, but we will now add additional devices in all parts of the country in Q3.

In Q2, we saw high sales of new devices in Japan. In this quarter, we saw better iPad sales with $1.1 billion in sales. On the other hand, we did see sales for the second quarter of 2016. We believe these changes will provide more value to our customers and, if we add more to our tablet and smartphone business, we may see an additional revenue share for Q3.

We are also working on an internal plan to add more technology to our network to increase our customers. In Q2, we will continue our partnership with Samsung on the world's largest tablet business. We believe that we're a great partner in the global smartphone business and that we are a great example of a technology company. To enhance our efforts in our business plan we are working with several partners, including Qualcomm and Alcatel-Lucent that are our key partners in the network hardware business.

Our mobile business is now performing quite well as shown at our Q2 earnings. This quarter we have introduced a new operating system and enhanced internal and external call center, with new software that has a potential to enhance our mobile-phone experience, and improvements to be made to our mobile-communications services. We continue to increase our user base at home and our mobile-mobile business is now seeing very strong growth. More phones are coming, and we will see more growth, particularly in the second half of the year, as the demand for smartphones for both the home and business environment improves and this brings more devices from the home.

Finally, I want to highlight that we have implemented a number of new initiatives with our Mobile Device portfolio. For example, we were able to deliver new mobile products on the iPad 3 (in Japan) to our more than 10 million customers. The company currently has 10 million mobile phones, and we are now ready to bring in the first generation of all the devices.

Overall, Q3 2016 saw a strong sales year of $1.7 billion in Q2. Sales of the second quarter of 2016 have been impressive, and I expect this to continue through Q3. On the other hand, that year was a lot of sales growth where we saw a lot of growth in tablets of a certain size or in devices with fewer buttons, especially in some markets where it was just under $3 billion.

What do you expect at our next GAAP release next week?","Q3 earnings share: We're now getting some strong numbers for the Q3 quarter.

MILAN: Giorgio Chiellini brought the curtain down on a trophy-packed career on Tuesday after the Italy icon announced his retirement from football.

Former Italy and Juventus defender Chiellini revealed he would be hanging up his boots at the age of 39 in a short post on social media accompanied by a video showing the highlights of his 23 years in the professional game.

""You have been the most beautiful and intense journey of my life. You have been my everything,"" Chiellini wrote.

""With you, I have travelled a unique and unforgettable path. But now it is time to start new chapters, face new challenges and write further important and exciting pages of life.""
Chiellini ended his career at Los Angeles FC in the Major Soccer League -- his final match Saturday's MLS Cup final defeat to Columbus Crew -- but he is best known for his exploits with Juventus and his country.

After joining Juve in 2005, Chiellini eventually became a cornerstone of the so-called ""BBC"" defence alongside Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci.

That defensive trio were key to propelling Juve back to domestic dominance after years in the doldrums following the 'Calciopoli' match-fixing scandal which exploded in the run-up to the 2006 World Cup.

Chiellini won nine consecutive Serie A titles between 2012 and 2020 and reached two Champions League finals with the Turin giants, who honoured him on social media with the message ""Warrior, captain, champion. Thanks for everything big Giorgio!""

Juve also posted a video depicting helicopters lifting a giant Juve jersey, emblazoned with 'Chiellini' and his squad number three, from the pitch at the club's Allianz Stadium.","Giorgio Chiellini, an Italy icon, announced his retirement from football at the age of 39.

On the eve of New Year 2014, Uttarakhand experienced light to moderate rains at isolated places in plains and snowfall in higher reaches. Areas in higher altitudes like Tapovan, Malari, Joshimath, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Kailash Mansarovar route, Auli, Nainital, Munsiyari and other polices received light to moderate snowfall.

The weather gods did not disappoint tourists thronging to the higher reaches of J&K and Himachal Pradesh with the hopes of ringing in a 'White New Year', but the heavy snowfall severely affected communications and traffic movement.

Kashmir was cut off from the rest of the country as heavy snowfall forced closure of several roads, including the arterial Srinagar-Jammu national highway, and led to the cancellation of all flights into and out of the city.

The snowfall brought about a jump in the mercury with Srinagar witnessing a nearly four degree rise in the minimum which settled at -1.4 degrees Celsius in the city, up from the -5.3 degrees recorded yesterday.

Although the weather in ladakh remained dry, the minimum there rose by several degrees with leh town seeing a low of -12.0 degrees, as against the -17.7 degrees recorded there the previous night.

The hills and valleys of Himachal Pradesh groaned under the biting cold amidst another spell of snowfall and widespread rain in the state.

Icy, strong velocity winds accompanied by rainfall and snow lashed Narkanda, Sarahan and other areas in the upper Shimla region with the Hindustan-Tibet National Highway blocked beyond Matiana as a result of fresh deposits.

Keylong and Kalpa in the lahaul and Spiti and Kinnaur districts, respectively, experienced moderate to heavy snowfall with the sky remaining largely overcast.

light to moderate rainfall also hit several places across Punjab and Haryana, leaving both states reeling under the chilly conditions.

Among the places which received rainfall were the Union Territory of Chandigarh, Amritsar, ludhiana, Pathankot, Phagwara, Jalandhar, Ambala, Panchkula, Sonepat and Karnal.

Narnaul in Haryana registered a low of 0.5 degrees while Hisar shivered at 1.5 degrees.

In Punjab, ludhiana and Amritsar saw the mercury settle at lows of 1.6 and 1.8 degrees, respectively. Western parts of Rajasthan continued to be in the grip of the intense cold with Jaisalmer recording the lowest minimum in the state at 1.7 degrees.","New Year's Eve in 2013 brought joy to the Kashmir Valley, Himachal Pradesh, and higher Uttarakhand regions with heavy snowfall, while northern India faced a persistent cold wave.

496273b91bc7af1f9bcbfabe9eb6ea30,"[DOC 1] West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya today regretted his statement on the Nandigram violence that villagers allegedly targeted by his CPM cadres were “paid back in their own coin.” He admitted he should not have said so.

Bhattacharya told mediapersons here that the violence in Nandigram was a “political and administrative” failure. He said, “We have learnt lessons from Nandigram that we have to take people into confidence... We have failed in Nandigram. It was an administrative and political failure.”

He affirmed that his priority was to bring back normalcy to the region in East Midnapore district where clashes between rival groups over land acquisition for industry since January left more than 35 persons dead.

Desiring peace for all, Bhattacharya, who is in the capital for the CPM politburo meeting, said that the situation in the troubled Nandigram blocks was “fast returning to normal” and most of those who had been evicted had already returned.

A total of Rs 1 crore had so far been spent by the Left Front government for their rehabilitation, including reconstruction and repair of damaged houses, roads, bridges as also supply of clothings, utensils and fertiliser mini-kits for the farmers to sow the rabi crop, he said.

The Chief Minister said a senior officer had been sent to the area to prepare a report on what kind of development projects could be implemented in the Nandigram area. “As soon as we get this report, I will announce the projects.”

He also claimed that the violence in Nandigram had not affected investments in the state. Bhattacharjee said, “Nandigram or no Nandigram, the process of industrialisation in West Bengal cannot be stopped.”

He said no corporate house, business group or foreign company had said they would withdraw from the state. “In fact, major foreign companies from Japan, the US, Singapore and Dubai have sent proposals” to invest in the state.

On the chemical hub, which was supposed to have come up at Nandigram, Bhattacharjee said it was now being set up at Nayachar, which did not have any habitation nor was the land arable.

About Bangladesh author Taslima Nasreen, who was shifted from Kolkata to Rajasthan and then to Delhi and subsequently to an undisclosed location following protests by a fundamentalist group last month, Bhattacharya said external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee would decide about the return of Taslima Nasreen to the Eastern metropolis.

Bhattacharjee also said he has no problem with the Governor, who earned the wrath of the top leadership of the ruling CPI-M for terming the manner of recapture of the Nandigram villages as “unlawful and unacceptable.”

“He is a nice man...I have good relations with him. We not only discuss politics but also literature. We exchange books also,” Bhattacharjee told reporters here.

He also denied reports that West Bengal government was seeking removal of Gandhi from the post.","West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya expressed regret for his previous statement regarding the Nandigram violence, stating that the villagers targeted by CPM cadres were “paid back in their own coin.” He admitted that he should not have made such remarks.

0477ce901b2836dd587205ab6347c51d,"[DOC 1]  All the hype and hoopla over the drugs case against Aryan Khan has come to nothing. Almost eight months after the registration of the case, in which the 24-year-old star kid spent 26 days in custody, the narcotics control bureau has given him and five other accused persons a clean chit.

The special investigation team of the NCB on Friday filed a 6,000-page charge sheet naming 14 accused. The agency said that the names of six persons, who were made accused by the earlier investigating team, including Aryan, Avin Sahu, Gopal Anand, Samir Sehgal, Bhaskar Arora and Manav Singhal have been dropped from the charge sheet for the “lack of sufficient evidence”.

In a statement, deputy director general Sanjay Kumar Singh of the NCB said, “SIT carried out an investigation in an objective manner. The touchstone of the principle of proof beyond reasonable doubt has been applied. Based on the investigation carried out by SIT, a complaint against 14 persons under various sections of NDPS Act is being filed. Complaint against rest six persons is not being filed due to lack of sufficient evidence.”

Among the five others exonerated in the case, Sahu was a guest of the cruise ship and the remaining four persons were the organisers of the party.

The charge sheet has been filed against Aryan’s friend Arbaaz Merchant (26), Munmun Dhamecha (28), Vikrant Chhokar (33), Mohak Jaiswal (28), Ishmeet Singh Chadha (33), Gomit Chopra (28), Nupur Satija (29), Abdul Kadar Shaikh (30), Shreyas Nair (23), Manish Rajgariya (30), Aachit Kumar (22), Chinedu Igwe (27), Shivraj Harijan (33) and Okoro Uzeoma (40).

An NCB team headed by then NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede raided the Cordelia Cruise Ship docked at Mumbai cruise terminal and claimed to have busted a drug party. The team arrested several people including Aryan from the ship. Though the investigators did not recover any drugs from Aryan’s position, they allegedly recovered six grams of charas from Merchant and five grams of hashish from Dhamecha.

Aryan was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 28 last year. In its order, the HC held that prima facie there was no evidence to infer that Aryan and his friend Arbaaz Merchant conspired to commit offences under the NDPS Act.

Following several controversies courted by Mr Wankhede’s style of function and personal allegations against him, the investigation was handed over to an SIT from NCB (New Delhi), headed by Sanjay Kumar Singh on November 6, 2021.

Welcoming the NCB’s admission that there wasn’t sufficient evidence against Aryan and no drugs were recovered from him, his lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, “The arrest and detention of Aryan Khan for 26 days was unjustified more particularly when he was not found in possession of any drugs, there was no evidence of any kind, there was no material of any nature of the violation of any law much less the NDPS Act. We are happy that the Special Investigation Team under Sanjay Kumar Singh investigated the case in an objective manner and decided not to file a complaint against Aryan Khan for lack of sufficient evidence. God is great. Satya Meva Jayate.”","The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in India has reportedly given a clean chit to Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, in a drug case. The NCB's special investigation team filed a 6,000-page charge sheet naming 14 accused, but dropped the names of six individuals, including Aryan Khan, due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Aryan Khan spent 26 days in custody last year after being arrested in connection with a drug party on a cruise ship. His lawyer welcomed the decision, stating that Aryan Khan's arrest and detention were unjustified, as he was not found in possession of any drugs.

41ce3003a8d9bd714f1d1433bd2aae72,"[DOC 1] No Rest in the Kingdom , a black comedy by Deepika Arwind, tells about how women deal with misogyny in their daily lives. The performance looks at the female performer’s body as a site of protest.

The play, a powerful one-woman physical theatre, performed at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) on Saturday, draws from the lives of urban characters who speak similar languages of consumerism and technology.

Daily annoyances
It deals with daily annoyances of being a woman in the country.

Masculinity in South Asia, especially India, is asserted and celebrated widely, says Deepika. “Its conventional manifestations are varied and dangerous, infecting different aspects of everyday life. Whether through the perpetration of rape culture in cinema and politics, or the palpable anxiety of the female body on the street, masculinity occupies oppressively large spaces, literally and figuratively,” she says.

Subverting masculinity
No Rest in the Kingdom has been created out of the desire to embody and subvert expressions of this masculinity through the body of a female performer, she says.

The kingdom is the current society where we live, where women are subjected to daily discrimination and violence.

Blurring the boundaries of genders, the actor embodies a variety of characters — male, female and feline — representing a gender and inter-species fluidity. The cat is a powerful motif that runs through the play.

How might her body, alone and vulnerable, serve as a metaphor for gender insensitivity and antagonism? How can her body transform into multiple sites of protest and how can humour, irreverence, and playfulness become her primary weapons of dissent and opposition?

This show has travelled to find resonance in different countries because its characters are archetypes of ‘masculinity’ familiar across cultures.

The play causes discomfort, sometimes scepticism. It breeds introspection and provokes conversations, Deepika says.

She avoids clichés, does not preach. But the play holds a mirror to the audience.

The characters she portrays sent the audience to howls of laughter.

But for every woman in the audience, there were scenes that they can identify deeply with. The play is produced by Sandbox Collective.","No Rest in the Kingdom, a one-woman black comedy by Deepika Arwind, explores how women confront everyday misogyny in society. Performed at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala, the play uses physical theatre to portray urban characters navigating consumerism and technology. It subverts traditional masculinity through humor and the female body as a protest tool. The performance blurs gender boundaries, using various archetypes to provoke introspection and challenge gender norms, resonating across cultures."
30fedb0510d5c5ece44a5742c5603cb9,"[DOC 1] Despite the rapid spread of Covid-19, several countries still haven't registered a single case of infection; Turkmenistan is one of them.

Many experts are concerned that the government of Turkmenistan may be hiding the truth, which could disrupt attempts to end the pandemic, reports the BBC.

Turkmenistan is holding a mass cycling rally to mark World Health Day on Tuesday; while the world battles coronavirus and more and more countries lock down their populations.

The Central Asian country is one of the most repressive states in the world and claims it still has zero coronavirus cases.

""Official health statistics from Turkmenistan are notoriously unreliable,"" said Professor Martin McKee from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has studied the Turkmen healthcare system.

""For the past decade they have claimed to have no people living with HIV/Aids, a figure that is not plausible. We also know that, in the 2000s, they suppressed evidence of a series of outbreaks, including plague.""

Many in Turkmenistan are even afraid of suggesting Covid-19 may already be in the country.

""My acquaintance who works in a state agency told me that I shouldn't say that the virus is here or that I heard about it, otherwise I may get into trouble,"" said a resident of the capital Ashgabat, who asked to remain anonymous.

The Turkmen authorities are, however, working on tackling a possible outbreak. Together with UN agencies in the country, they are discussing a plan of action.

The UN Resident Co-ordinator, Elena Panova said the plan included country level co-ordination, risk communication, case investigation, laboratory diagnostics and other measures.

When asked whether the UN trusted the official figures showing Turkmenistan had no confirmed Covid-19 cases, Panova avoided giving a straight answer.

""We are relying on official information because this is what all countries are doing,"" she said.

""There is no question of trust because that's the way it works.""

Panova said early measures on restricting travel might have contributed to lack of confirmed cases.

Turkmenistan closed most of its land border crossings more than a month ago. It also cancelled flights to China and some other countries in early February and started diverting all international flights from the capital to Turkmenabat in the north-east, where a quarantine zone was created.

However, according to several residents, some people were able bribe their way out of the zone and avoid two weeks of isolation in a tent.

Panova said everyone arriving in the country and those showing symptoms were being tested for Covid-19. However, she could not give exact figures of how many tests were conducted a day and how many test kits Turkmenistan had overall.

""What we understand in talking to government officials is that they have sufficient tests.""

""However, if there is an outbreak that's a huge pressure on the health system like in any other country. So, irrespective of how much you have prepared, it usually is insufficient. That's why we are already talking to them about procuring ventilators, and also other types of equipment.""

Movement between cities has been restricted and those who enter Ashgabat must now have a doctor's note.

Markets and offices are being fumigated with smoke from a type of grass called yuzarlik, used in herbal remedies, after President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov said burning it would ward off the virus - despite there being no evidence.

Unlike most of the world, daily life in Turkmenistan continues as normal. Cafes and restaurants are open. Crowds gather for weddings. Nobody wears masks and mass events are going ahead.

It appears the country is in denial about admitting the major threat posed by coronavirus.

","Despite global concerns over COVID-19, Turkmenistan claims zero cases, sparking skepticism. Experts fear government suppression of information, citing past instances of concealing outbreaks. Residents hesitate to acknowledge the virus, fearing repercussions. While the UN discusses preparedness, trust in official figures remains uncertain. Turkmenistan closed borders and implemented travel restrictions but faces bribery allegations for quarantine evasion. Testing rates and equipment availability are unclear. President Berdymukhamedov promotes unproven remedies as daily life carries on unaffected, with no masks worn and events proceeding. Turkmenistan's response raises doubts about addressing the pandemic, portraying a state seemingly in denial.

(His official 4 Rajaji Marg residence is under renovation.) His twin Dachshunds, Dash and Tickle, shoot around like little guided torpedoes clad in identical red-and- black-trimmed winter fleece. Staff officers and Tavor rifle-wielding bodyguards of the special forces flank the fleet of black armoured Scorpios waiting to make the short two km drive to his office deep within the sandstone corridors of South Block. The general appears in the verandah of his home, proffers a firm handshake. He's of medium height, stockily built, with salt and pepper hair and a neatly trimmed white moustache. He listens carefully, looks you in the eye when he speaks, and the clearly articulated sentences are delivered like a military drum roll. He clearly plays on the front foot. There is simply no question that will induce any hesitation on his part, from tackling China and Pakistan, surgical strikes, the controversial Cold Start war doctrine to the polemic around his selection as army chief, superseding two senior army commanders. As he sat down for an extensive interview with Executive Editor Sandeep Unnithan, General Rawat revealed why he was supremely confident of navigating the minefield that lies ahead in his three-year tenure. Excerpts:What do you see as your main security challenges and how do you plan to handle developments like the reorganisation of China's armed forces?The primary role of the armed forces is the defence of the borders, preparation for conventional warfare, maintaining internal security and focusing on disaster relief. We are studying the restructuring of the PLA to see its efficacy. We will study their reforms and see whether they have relevance in our context. If so, we will put them across with modifications to the government.The army's China-specific Mountain Strike Corps has been languishing for want of funds. Is this relevant in our context?We raised the Mountain Strike Corps (MSC) as part of a transition from dissuasion and deterrence to credible deterrence. All adversaries respect credible strength, which comes from such formations capable of striking across the border. We are expected to remain defensive in order to ensure there are no incursions and the sanctity of the borders is maintained. But you cannot always remain defensive. We must also have the capability to conduct offensive operations. Whether these forces are going to be used physically will depend on the situation, but surely these forces meet the purpose of credible deterrence. So, we'll certainly give impetus to raising the corps. The government has given us permission to induct manpower, infrastructure development along the border is taking place, weapons and equipment are coming in.Did the army's September 29, 2016 surgical strikes define our new red lines in a strong response to a high-casualty attack by terrorists?All nations and armies define their own thresholds. The December 13, 2001 Parliament attack was a threshold. In a terrorist attack, it is the nature of the attack and the success the terrorists are able to achieve-sometimes what happens is that the terrorists get success because of incidental damage caused. Uri, for example, was an incidental success because there were troops in tents, troops who were grouped together. In Nagrota, they did not get so much success, they did not get so many people, we were able to eliminate them before they could do damage. So the threshold level will vary and [determine] the kind of reaction, because our nation is not a warmongering nation. We want peace and tranquility, and if we find that something can be resolved through negotiations, an attempt is always made to resolve it through negotiations but if we find these incidents getting repeated, we define a threshold, a decision is taken, recommendations are made, and we will go across again. It is very difficult to say if there are red lines (in response to terrorist attacks). What I can say is that there are dotted lines, and those dots are then joined together by us to draw a red line.Is the Cold Start doctrine-instituted after Operation Parakram in 2001-still an option in response to attacks like the one on Parliament in 2001 or 26/11 in Mumbai?The Cold Start doctrine exists for conventional military operations. Whether we have to conduct conventional operations for such strikes is a decision well-thought through, involving the government and the Cabinet Committee on Security.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, in the combined commanders' conference in 2015, said that future conflicts will become shorter, and wars will become rare. Do you have any strategy for short, intense wars?In our case, we prepare for short, intense conflicts, and at the same time have to be prepared for wars becoming long-drawn. Based on that, we have a well-defined strategy. What the PM said is right; wars will be intense and short because there'll always be international pressure in wars between two nations. We have to be aware of that; whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready and have to achieve success.The modernisation of the Indian Army has been an area of major concern for you and your predecessors. Have you identified any key areas for delivery during your tenure?Technology is constantly changing. You cannot be using older technologies for your weapons systems and equipment. My thinking is that you have to look at emerging technology because of the time it takes for a weapons system to be inducted into the armed forces. So you have to look at tomorrow's technology for inducting weapons. With that in mind, we have also focused on certain weapons systems. Infantry is the most affected-deployed along the border round the clock, in internal security situations, and in the face of frequent ceasefire violations on the border-we need to give them modern weapons technology best suited to such an environment. The mechanised forces need future battle tanks and Infantry Combat Vehicles, new aviation assets, air defence systems, artillery and other longer ranged weapon systems that have more lethality and accuracy. We are also looking at upgrading operational logistics systems. The modernisation priorities have been spelt out by my predecessor [Gen. Dalbir Singh] and we are continuing with the same vision and thrust areas because I feel they have been thought through and holistically define the army's requirements.Do you see an emerging threat in the new China-Pakistan proximity and how do you propose to respond to it?National security strategy by any nation is defined by its national interests. China has defined its national interests by coming close to Pakistan in looking for access to the Indian Ocean Region, for energy security, trade. Today, economics defines national strategy and wherever people find economic gain, there are cooperative mechanisms and alliances. We also have to look at our national interests and continue doing whatever is best in our national interests. We will also counter such mechanisms through our own means; our government is quite capable of handling [these]. We are also carrying out actions to negate the nexus developing between China and Pakistan.Would you elaborate on these measures?We are addressing the neighbourhood, the extended neighborhood and the Far West. We are looking at certain countries on China's eastern seaboard, and the Americas. There are groupings that are taking place. While we are proud of being non-aligned, there are times when you have to get into some groupings, which is of course in the domain of foreign policy, so I wouldn't like to really comment. We have masters in foreign policy and they do it really well. Our diplomacy is moving well, the prime minister's focus is on the global arena, we will be able to counter whatever is happening through our foreign policy.What are your expectations from a closer military partnership with the United States?Our expectations are that we must live like friends - the economic partnership will grow stronger and everything else will fall into place. We are sharing expertise but that is more in the field of humanitarian assistance and disaster response. We do try out some joint training as far as counter-insurgency [is concerned]. The US does consider us a lead nation in Counter Insurgency Ops; they have specialisation in special forces operations which we look at. As for equipment, we have a system of global tendering, and I feel we should go for whoever gives us the best. Finally, we should support our domestic industry. What it will depend on is who is willing to come here, share technology and help our domestic industry grow and help us in becoming self-reliant, so we needn't be country-fixated.We have been hearing a lot about the rivalry between the infantry and the armoured corps. Would you set the record straight on this?
","Newly-appointed Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has said that the Indian forces would cross the border again if peace and tranquility are not maintained after attempting to resolve things through negotiations. ""Wars will be intense and short because there will always be international pressure... Whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready,"" Rawat added.

521ad294fba58c02a3efa01a89f0d207,"[DOC 1] It is indeed tragic that our MPs can use any trick in the book to bring to a halt any serious business that needs to be done for the development of our country. Their behaviour, their use of language and their lack of any level of tolerance is something that shames the system of parliamentary democracy every time the House is in session.
We elect our MPs to work and ensure that they represent the people; we also recognise that many of them have huge personal agendas. What we need is legislation from our sessions, not just high decibel drivel. And this is exactly what the Indian Parliament has come to. Debates are out of the window and have instead been replaced by duels, often of the non-verbal kind.
I would imagine some of our MPs are slowly losing a sense of their responsibility but more importantly they stay cocooned, protected by parliamentary privilege. The oratory of parliamentarians such as Nehru, Piloo Mody, Vajpayee has been replaced by a rustic drawl and undignified behaviour.
Can we change this? I am certain we can. The Speaker needs to be even more firm than he is; members need to be expelled; expunging their comments will not suffice. I also recommend telecast of parliamentary proceedings live through the day â€” which is when you will see how some of our MPs use the House as an effective sleep chamber than a chamber for crafting legislation.
MPs in India are a favoured lot. And the tragedy is they know it better than anyone else. They get amazing perks: from free travel up to a certain limit to subsidised meals to free telephone calls and free medical benefits â€” all on taxpayerâ€™s money. Some of us may think this justified as they are working hard for us. But when sessions get disrupted as often as they do, when legislation is replaced by rowdy behaviour, all we are left with is their perks and no pro-gress. This is my real worry. At this stage of our development we cannot be subsidising bad behaviour only to remain within the propriety of what has been traditional in a manner of speaking.
The only way we can change all this is by urgently indexing all compensation for MPs to the amount of work they do in the House. Recall their perks; remove all the freebies till real work gets done. We are not a nation that can afford for our policy-makers to be using the venerable House as a soap-box at Hyde Park. The day we are able to index compensation to effectiveness we will see a new culture within the Houses. Till then, some of our more accomplished and venerable MPs will be as sad as probably we are, at seeing the gradual demise of yet another great institution in India.
","Concerns are raised over the disruptive behavior of Members of Parliament (MPs) in India, impacting legislative work. The author suggests solutions like stricter enforcement by the Speaker, expulsion of disruptive members, and live telecasts for enhanced accountability. The piece also proposes linking MPs' compensation to their performance in the House to prioritize responsibilities.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi trained his guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his failure to address the issue of alleged corruption by the BJP government in Karnataka.

Speaking at an election rally in Chamarajanagar near here on Monday, Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister remains mum on the alleged corruption during the BJP regime in Karnataka that has earned notoriety as a “40 percent commission” Government.

Though the Contractors’ Association of Karnataka wrote to him a letter alleging the demand for 40 percent commission by the representatives of the government to clear the bills of the contractors, Mr. Modi did not even bother to reply to the letter, he said. Mr. Gandhi also cited the seizure of ₹8 crore from the residence of a BJP MLA’s son recently in the Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited scandal as a case in point.

8b79c215ea355c74bd8a11958d2e43a5,"[DOC 1] MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Saturday cautioned new Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis against taking the people for granted and asked him to fulfil the expectations of the common man.

“The new government is like a newly-wed woman who initially pleases her mother-in-law. In this case the mother-in-law is the people of Maharashtra. You cannot take people for granted. They have the power to pull your ears when you err,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said. 

This is the first lesson the new government will have to learn, the Sena said amid signs of a rapprochement between the saffron parties, who parted ways on September 25, just weeks before the Assembly polls, which saw BJP emerging as the single largest party in the state.

It is true that there is no magic wand to fulfil promises made (during polls) but people of Maharashtra are looking at the new government, the first led by BJP, with a lot of hope, the publication said.

“Mantralaya (the State Secretariat) was gutted during the Congress-NCP rule but the aspirations of people had turned into ashes much before that. The new Chief Minister should ensure that his work is like the proverbial Phoenix which rose from the ashes,” the Sena organ maintained.

Describing Friday’s swearing-in ceremony of the Fadnavis-led Ministry as grand (it was also attended by corporate bigwigs), the Sena said the poor, and not the rich or money bags, should get the attention of the administration as was the case during Shivaji’s era. 

“Fadnavis has said he will emulate Shivaji Maharaj’s example while ruling the state. He should remember that the real strength of Shivaji’s Hindavi swarajya was not the seth and sahukars but the common poor folk.”

Thackeray attended the inauguration ceremony at Wankhede Stadium after a call from BJP president Amit Shah and other leaders. The party had earlier announced it would keep off the mega event, attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing “constant humiliation” by BJP ahead of Government formation.

Sena MP Vinayak Raut on Friday said Shah had assured Thackeray of a positive decision on participation of his party in the BJP Government. ","The Shiv Sena issued a cautionary message to Maharashtra's new Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis, urging him to prioritize fulfilling the expectations of the common people. In an editorial in their mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena likened the new government's relationship with the people to that of a newly-wed woman and her mother-in-law, emphasizing that the administration should not take the public for granted. Despite recent tensions between the Shiv Sena and BJP, signs of reconciliation have emerged following the Assembly polls. The Sena stressed the importance of the new government addressing the aspirations of the people, highlighting the need for governance that uplifts the common citizen. While acknowledging the grandeur of Fadnavis' swearing-in ceremony, the Sena underscored the importance of prioritizing the welfare of the poor over corporate interests, drawing parallels to the leadership of Shivaji Maharaj. The Sena's attendance at the inauguration ceremony signaled a potential thaw in relations with BJP, following assurances from BJP president Amit Shah regarding the party's participation in the government."
0abba4e410e4dc0d6399a14f74bcea70,"[DOC 1] In an era where economic disparity is at its peak, one can always rely on the Ambanis to provide the much-needed comic relief. The recent splurge on Anant Ambani’s wedding has once again reminded us why the rich remain rich – by spending copious amounts of money on events that could rival entire national budgets. How dare they? Let’s dive into the outrage, shall we?

When news broke that Mukesh Ambani, India’s wealthiest man, had decided to spend a small fortune on his son Anant’s wedding, the collective gasp could be heard across the globe. “How inconsiderate,” cried the masses, “to spend money that could have been used to solve world hunger on a mere wedding!”

Indeed, it was a sight to behold. Lavish decorations that could have been mistaken for the set of a Bollywood blockbuster, celebrities who charged appearance fees higher than the GDP of some small countries, and an orchestra that probably cost more than a new fleet of Rolls-Royces. Oh, the horror!

Of course, this grandiose display did not sit well with the common man. “Where is our bailout?” screamed a small business owner, forgetting momentarily that he wouldn’t want to share the limelight with the glitzy guest list. “What about the poor?” questioned an armchair activist, conveniently ignoring their penchant for imported avocado toast.

The public outcry was fierce. Twitter threads, Facebook rants, and WhatsApp forwards spread like wildfire. “How can they be so out of touch?” they asked, while simultaneously queuing up for the latest iPhone release.

It’s a well-known fact that the rich should only spend their money on the poor. Extravagance is reserved for the middle class, who can proudly show off their small luxuries without facing the wrath of public scrutiny. The Ambanis’ decision to host a wedding that could feed a small nation was, therefore, a moral affront.

Philanthropy, after all, is best done quietly and without drawing attention. Unlike a wedding, where privacy is tantamount to scandal. How dare they use their own money to make their own choices? The nerve!

The first tragedy, of course, lies in the excessive luxury. What society needs now more than ever is for its billionaires to show restraint. The millions of roses imported from the farthest corners of the globe are a clear affront to the simple bouquet enthusiasts. The fleets of private jets ferrying guests have, undoubtedly, caused immense psychological trauma to the humble bike riders of the nation.

In all this hullabaloo, one might overlook the fact that the money spent on Anant Ambani’s wedding did indeed go back into the economy. Thousands of jobs were created, artisans found work, Justin Beiber, Rihanna, and Bollywood actors found work, and the hospitality industry saw a boom. But let’s not get bogged down by such trivialities. The real issue here is that the rich should feel guilty about their wealth – and that guilt should translate into a modest, preferably invisible, lifestyle.

Imagine the distress of the elite class, whose own weddings now appear humble in comparison. What is a diamond-studded cake when Anant Ambani’s dessert table is a glittering mountain? The deep psychological scars left on the wealthy who must now up their game to remain relevant cannot be understated. Sympathy cards are in order for these besieged souls, struggling under the weight of outshone opulence.

It’s fascinating to note the thin line between envy and indignation. The same people who cry foul over the Ambani’s extravagance wouldn’t bat an eyelid if given the chance to attend such a grand affair. Oh, to rub shoulders with the elite, to be a part of the spectacle! But alas, they are left to watch from afar, simmering in their self-righteous fury.

While it’s true that the Ambani family has engaged in philanthropy, it is, frankly, not enough. Feeding the hungry, providing education, and funding healthcare are all well and good, but what we really need is a billionaire who embraces asceticism. Why build hospitals when one can build modest bamboo huts and set a true example?

As the echoes of Anant Ambani’s wedding celebrations fade, we are left to ponder the true cost of such opulence. The solution, as always, lies in our collective inaction. Let us sit back, continue to critique from our high horses, and do nothing substantive to address wealth disparity. After all, it’s much easier to bemoan the splurges of the rich than to engage in meaningful societal change. In the end, the tragicomedy of Anant Ambani’s wedding serves as a poignant reminder: the real problem isn’t the billionaires’ spending; it’s our insistence on not looking in the mirror.

So here’s to the beautiful couple, Radhika Merchant and Anant Ambani, and their fabulously opulent wedding. Stay blessed!","The extravagant wedding of Anant Ambani, hosted by Mukesh Ambani, has sparked widespread outrage over the perceived misuse of wealth. Critics argue that such lavish spending—replete with opulent decorations and high-profile celebrities—should be redirected towards addressing global issues like poverty. Public outcry highlights the irony of the elite's splurges, which are seen as a moral affront, despite the economic benefits of such events, including job creation and industry stimulation. The satire underscores a broader societal issue: the disparity between the rich’s opulence and the public’s expectations for modesty, revealing a deeper discontent with wealth inequality and hypocrisy."
cb2b3f26752e592d4095ca5052fe6b03,"[DOC 1] PUNE:Around 2,000 banners, posters and cut-outs belonging to several political parties, which were erected in public places in various parts of the city, have been pulled down in separate drives by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in the last couple of days.

District collector Madhukar Kokate, who is also the returning officer for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, had issued orders to the PMC, in accordance with the election code of conduct.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, additional municipal commissioner D.S. Zagade said the election code prohibits political parties or their well-wishers from installing such unauthorised hoardings or banners, which could influence the voter.

Zagade said he has appointed all the 14 divisional ward officers as nodal officers to carry out the drive against the illegal hoardings â€” expenses of which are not accounted for by the political parties.


Exercising these powers, the civic teams headed by the 14 ward officers have so far removed around 1,463 banners, 229 hoardings, 162 cut-outs and 133 posters. While asserting that the civic staff will continue with its action, Zagade has issued letters to the chiefs of all political parties in the city, appealing to them to direct their party workers to stay away from installing such illegal posters, banners or posters.","The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has undertaken drives to remove approximately 2,000 unauthorized banners, posters, and cut-outs erected by various political parties across the city.

New Delhi has decided to beef up security for Indians working on several government projects in Afghanistan. Two special teams sent to Afghanistan to review the security situation last month have, however, ruled out recalling Indians working there. The teams, made up of senior security experts and external affairs ministry officials, have instead recommended that additional security personnel be deployed to ensure the safety of Indians associated with ""humanitarian"" projects.
 
The security review was carried out after five Indians took refuge at the Indian consulate in Kandahar (reported in HT) after receiving life threats in December last year. The two doctors and three paramedics attached to the Indian medical mission in the city are still at the consulate but attend the medical mission daily.
 
While in Kabul, the two teams met with local security authorities to discuss ways of enhancing security for Indians attached to projects that can't be halted midway. It has also been decided that intelligence exchange will be intensified.

According to sources, it is evident that the threats being issued to Indians to abandon their work and leave Afghanistan are serious and not a ""one-off"" incident. There is reportedly enough evidence gathered by local intelligence and Indian authorities to indicate that these threats are coming from resurgent Taliban groups still active along the Afghan-Pak border.An MEA official has disclosed that the Taliban continues to issue threats to Indians. ""The security situation is far from comfortable. This was known when India started its projects there. At the same time, it is imperative to carry on with the humanitarian work there. Those manning hospitals, dispensaries and involved with road construction projects were fully aware before leaving for Afghanistan that they would have to work under adverse security conditions.""

According to the official, Indian doctors attend to as many as 300 patients a day. The Indian medical mission on the Iran-Afghanistan border is the only place for medical aid in the region.","India has decided to strengthen security for its citizens working on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan, amid serious threats believed to be issued by resurgent Taliban groups operating near the Afghan-Pakistan border.

Following threats in Kandahar last December, where five Indian medical staff took refuge at the consulate, two expert teams were sent to review security. Their report ruled out recalling Indians but recommended deploying additional security personnel.

Meetings in Kabul led to agreements on enhanced intelligence sharing and cooperation with Afghan authorities. Despite dangers, Indian officials insist that their mission must continue, especially given the critical services provided—like the Indian medical mission, which treats up to 300 patients a day and serves as the only healthcare center in the region."
