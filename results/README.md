# Results

This folder contains prediction files and evaluation results for NewsSumm experiments.

## Files
- `predictions/` – Model-generated summaries
- `newssumm_benchmark_scores.csv` – ROUGE-based benchmark table

## Notes
Due to compute constraints, results are reported for a subset of baseline models.  
All experiments follow identical preprocessing and evaluation settings.
