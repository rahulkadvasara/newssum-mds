As an actor, his first notable role was in Terrence Malick?s Days of Heaven in 1978. He went on to star in Baby Boom, Steel Magnolias, The Pelican Brief, Black Hawk Down, The Notebook and August: Osage County. He was most recently seen in the Netflix drama Bloodline, alongside Sissy Spacek.He was known as an acclaimed character actor rather than an A-lister, a route he chose early in his career. ?I had all kinds of wild offers at that time to be a movie star and I panicked,? he later said. ?I was turning down things like Warren Beatty?s Reds, that part of Eugene O?Neill [played by Jack Nicholson]. My agent was going crazy. I hadn?t realized what the experience of it would be like ? to be on the verge of being a movie star. Because it?s like you are the hottest whore in town. Everybody wants you.?When asked about his performances on stage, he said he wasn?t quite as comfortable as on screen. ?You don?t have to do anything in the movies,? he said in an interview with the New York Times. ?You just sit there. Well, that?s not entirely true. You do less. I find the whole situation of confronting an audience terrifying.?Before his death, he completed a role in the psychological thriller Never Here with Mireille Enos. This year also saw the release of his book The One Inside, a series of conversations with himself. He is survived by three children.Figures from both stage and screen have paid tribute to Shepard on Twitter. Writer Beau Willimon referred to him as ?fearless? and ?one of the greats?, Harlan Coben tweeted: ?How special was he?
