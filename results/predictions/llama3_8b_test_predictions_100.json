Alaska State Troopers say the five Italians were rescued Saturday from a camp they set up after visiting the dilapidated bus on the Stampede Trail near the interior town of Healy.\n\nThe rescue was the latest episode involving the bus, first made famous by Jon Krakauer\u2019s 1996 book Into the Wild and then by Sean Penn\u2019s 2007 film of the same name.(Movie still)\n\nThe hikers were found 13 miles from the trailhead, Trooper spokesman Tim DeSpain said. He didn\u2019t know how far they were from the bus.\n\nOne of the hikers had frostbite to his feet and was transported to Fairbanks for treatment, DeSpain said. The hiker\u2019s injuries are not considered life-threatening. The other four hikers were picked up by friends in Healy.\n\nRescuers were alerted by the hikers with a satellite-based emergency device that notified the International Emergency Response Coordination Center of a medical emergency, troopers said. That international group then notified rescuers, who reached the site by snowmobile, DeSpain said.\n\nThe rescue was the latest episode involving the bus, first made famous by Jon Krakauer\u2019s book published in 1996 and then by Sean Penn\u2019s 2007 film of the same name. Both fueled a lingering mystique about a young idealist, Christopher McCandless, who met his death from starvation in the bus, which is about 10 miles north of the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve. Over the years, some hikers have been rescued and others have died while trying to retrace McCandless\u2019 last steps. In July, a newlywed woman from Belarus died after she was swept away by the Teklanika River while trying to reach the bus with her husband.\n\nIn 2013, three German hikers trying to reach the bus were rescued after a river they crossed became impassable because of high, fast-moving water. Families of some of those who died are now behind a proposal before Denali Borough for a feasibility study for construction of a footbridge over the Teklanika.\n\nThe idea is in the early stages, and no decision has been made. But borough Mayor Clay Walker said there are several concerns among officials. A footbridge might give people a false sense of security. It could lead to more people trying to reach the bus, and that could lead to more rescues, Walker said.\n\nThere are more hazards in the unforgiving wilderness surrounding the bus, as Saturday\u2019s rescue illustrates.\n\n\u201cA footbridge wouldn\u2019t have changed the need for a rescue,\u201d Walker said. As far as he\u2019s concerned, a better solution would be to remove the bus. \u201cThe fact that the bus is there raises that attraction level,\u201d he said.\n\nSummary: Five Italian tourists, including one with frostbite, were rescued in the Alaska wilderness after visiting an abandoned bus made famous by the book and movie \"Into the Wild\". The hikers were found 13 miles from the trailhead and were rescued by snowmobile after alerting rescuers with a satellite-based emergency device.\n\n[DOC 2] The Indian government has announced plans to launch a new satellite-based navigation system, called the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), which will provide accurate and reliable navigation services to users in the country.

But in an early, well-judged interview to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading newspaper La Republica, Gandhi has firmly established the rules of the game: No interviews in Italian. No response to \"feelings as an Italian\".\n\nIn a remarkable balancing act that Italians are reading as a gentle, if understandable put-down to the country of her birth, Gandhi granted one of her first post-victory interviews to La Republica, Italy''s leading centre-left daily.\n\nWith a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi behind her, raved La Republica''s Asia correspondent Raimundo Bultrini, Gandhi conducted a long and earnest conversation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but significantly, in English.\n\nReported Bultrini, \"she asked that the conversation be in English because after so many years, her Italian is not so good anymore. Gandhi went on to bat aside the first, potentially-loaded question: \"What do you feel as an Italian, a Hindu and the winner of elections?\"\n\nThe Congress president bluntly replied, First of all, I have no feeling as an Italian. Because I feel Indian. I am Indian\". Despite Gandhi''s careful straddling of the delicate Italian-Indian line, La Republica''s amazing upsurge of emotion and interest was reflected across the country.\n\nBoth this paper and the more moderate Corriera della sierra front-paged Gandhi''s win with the lyrical headline \"An Italian triumph in India\".\n\nLa Republica sympathetically highlighted Gandhi''s defiance against \"attacks on me (Sonia) because for Indians, I am one of them\".\n\n\n\nLooking Back: Sonia Gandhi with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Premier Li Peng toast after the signing of three Sino-Indian agreements in Beijing on Dec. 22, 1988. (AP Photo)\nAnd in a flush of emotion it deputed a reporter to visit Gandhi''s home village of Orbassanolan, near Turin, only to report that this Piedmontese region of Italy feels a mix of \"pride and fear for Sonia''s life\".\n\nIn possibly an exclusive interview, the paper quotes Sonia''s niece, Aruna Vinci to say \"My aunt is an exceptional woman. Not many would have stayed in India after all that happened to her family and kept believing in the same mission. But she did and the Indians understood that and gave her a prize for that\".\n\nMeanwhile, La Stampa, published out of Turin, just down the road from Sonia''s childhood home, the via Bellini, asked the key question: \"Who is Sonia Maino destined to guide the greatest democracy of the world?\"\n\nOffering a brief potted guide to the life and times of Sonia''s builder father, Stefano Eugene Maino, it concludes with the news that Orbassano''s mayor Carl Browns is desperately searching for an address to send a congratulatory telegram to the region''s most famous daughter.\n\n\"Kind Mrs. Sonia Maino Gandhi, we are much happy by your election and hope that soon you can return to visit your city d''origine\", the paper quotes Browns to say.\n\nSummary: Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president, has granted an interview to Italy's leading newspaper La Republica, but refused to respond to questions in Italian, stating that her Italian is not good enough. She emphasized her Indian identity and rejected the idea of having feelings as an Italian. The interview was widely reported in Italy, with many newspapers expressing pride and admiration for Sonia's achievements.\n\n[DOC 2] NEW DELHI: The Congress party's victory in the recent general elections has been hailed as a major triumph for the party, with many attributing the win to the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, the party's president.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Times of India, Gandhi spoke about her party's victory, saying that it was a testament to the people's faith in the party's policies and its ability to deliver on its promises.\n\n\"We have been able to connect with the people and understand their needs and aspirations,\" Gandhi said. \"Our party's victory is a reflection of the people's trust in us and",

There's a mix of pride and concern in Sonia's ancestral village in Italy, where her niece speaks highly of her dedication.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kharge accused the Modi-led government of neglecting the country\u2019s agrarian economy and abandoning the promise of doubling farmers\u2019 income. He took aim at BJP leaders from Karnataka, especially Union Ministers, for remaining silent on the issue and failing to safeguard the interests of their own state\u2019s farmers. \u201cA decade ago, the BJP came to power with grand promises of doubling farmers\u2019 incomes and building an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Today, those promises lie in ruins,\u201d Kharge said. \u201cBJP\u2019s Union Ministers from Karnataka appear more focused on peddling hate than standing up for the rightful interests of the state they represent.\u201d Karnataka is the largest tur dal-producing state in India, contributing over 40 percent of national output, with Kalaburagi district alone producing the majority of the state's yield. The region is known for the GI-tagged Kalaburagi Tur, prized for its quality. Kharge pointed out that in the 2024\u201325 season, India produced 35 lakh metric tonnes of tur, but the Centre procured less than 10 percent of it. Karnataka alone produced 10 lakh quintals, but farmers were forced to sell at \u20b96,000 per quintal\u2014well below the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of \u20b97,550\u2014resulting in an estimated loss of \u20b91,550 crore. \"This year\u2019s MSP has been raised to \u20b98,000, but market prices have crashed to \u20b96,250, nearly half of last year\u2019s rates,\" Kharge said. \"Why? Because the Centre is flooding the market with cheap, low-quality tur from abroad, turning its back on our farmers.\u201d He also criticised the Centre\u2019s decision to keep tur imports duty-free since May 2021, a policy extended until March 2026. According to Kharge, over 13 lakh metric tonnes of tur were imported in 2024\u201325, and the government has signed MoUs to bring in an additional 2 lakh metric tonnes from countries like Mozambique. Kharge cited the Centre's own Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) report, which noted Karnataka had demanded an MSP of \u20b916,548, based on a production cost of \u20b911,032. However, the Centre fixed the MSP at \u20b98,000. Calling the Centre\u2019s import policy \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201canti-farmer,\u201d Kharge demanded immediate corrective measures to protect the livelihoods of Indian farmers and restore price stability in the market.\n\nSummary: Karnataka's Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge has criticized the Union government for flooding the Indian market with cheap, low-quality tur dal imports, which has severely impacted domestic farmers, particularly those in Karnataka.

The store is the main place where hundreds of millions of people around the world download and install apps that work on smartphones powered by Google's Android software.Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed a lawsuit against Google three years ago, alleging that the internet search giant has been abusing its power to shield its Play Store from competition in order to protect a gold mine that makes billions of dollars annually. Just as Apple does for its iPhone app store, Google collects a commission ranging from 15 per cent to 30 per cent on digital transactions completed within apps.Apple prevailed in a similar case that Epic brought against the iPhone app store. But that 2021 trial was decided by a federal judge in a ruling that is under appeal at the US Supreme Court.\nThe nine-person jury in the Play store case apparently saw things through a different lens, even though Google technically allows Android apps to be downloaded from different stores an option that Apple prohibits on the iPhone.\nJust before the Play store trial started, Google sought to avoid having a jury determine the outcome, only to have its request rejected by US District Judge James Donato. Now it will be up to Donato to determine what steps Google will have to take to unwind its illegal behaviour in the Play Store. The judge indicated he will hold hearings on the issue during the second week of January.Epic CEO Tim Sweeney broke into a wide grin after the verdict was read and slapped his lawyers on the back and also shook the hand of a Google attorney, whom he thanked for his professional attitude during the proceedings.\n\"Victory over Google!\" Sweeney wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In a company post, Epic hailed the verdict as \"a win for all app developers and consumers around the world.\" Google plans to appeal the verdict, according to a statement from Wilson White, the company's vice president of government affairs and public policy.\n\"Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform,\" White said.Depending on how the judge enforces the jury's verdict, Google could lose billions of dollars in annual profit generated from its Play Store commissions.

Combined with the rival app stores pre-installed on devices made by other companies, more than 60 per cent of Android phones offer alternative outlets for Android apps.Epic, though, presented evidence asserting the notion that Google welcomes competition as a pretense, citing the hundreds of billions of dollars it has doled out to companies, such as game maker Activision Blizzard, to discourage them from opening rival app stores. Besides making these payments, Bornstein also urged the jury to consider the Google \"scare screens\" that pop up warning consumers of potential security threats when they try to download Android apps from some of the alternatives to the Play Store.\n\"These are classic anticompetitive strategies used by dominant firms to protect their monopolies,\" Bornstein said.\nGoogle's empire could be further undermined by another major antitrust trial in Washington that will be decided by a federal judge after hearing final arguments in May. That trial has cast a spotlight on Google's cozy relationship with Apple in online search, the technology that turned Google into a household word a few years after two former Stanford University graduate students started the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.\n\n\n\nSummary: A federal court jury has found that Google's Android app store has been protected by anticompetitive barriers, damaging smartphone consumers and software developers.

However, Air India will have to become competitive. They will have to restructure their costs in line with the industry as a whole because the government cannot keep pouring money into it,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivate airlines, however, will have to learn to fend for themselves. This was his clear message to Vijay Mallya, ruling out a bailout for either Kingfisher Airlines or any other cash-strapped private carrier hoping for such clemency from the government.\n\n\u201cKingfisher is a private enterprise and banks can only lend if they are satisfied with the business plan of the company. If the banks feel they can recover their money and make profits, they will lend, otherwise not,\u201d he said when asked if the government was willing to give financial support to the Mallya-promoted airline.\n\nKingfisher had recently sought Singh\u2019s help, saying that the company would not be able to sustain the present scale of operations it did not get government help soon.\n\nThe silver lining for struggling-for-survival airlines is that Ajit Singh is in favour of allowing foreign companies to buy equity in Indian carriers, a demand being pursued mostly by Mallya who feels that FDI would help them raise the much- needed equity. \u201cYes, I am in favour of 49 per cent FDI,\u201d the Civil Aviation Minister categorically told The Tribune.\n\nThe idea to increase the FDI cap from the earlier proposed 26 per cent to 49 per cent was recently mooted by a committee of secretaries. The Group of Ministers (GoM) is likely to discuss the issue in a day or two.\n\n\u201cFinally, the Cabinet will take the decision. The Committee of Secretaries has recommended raising the FDI limit in the sector,\u201d Singh said.\n\nHowever, apart from Mallya, there are not many takers for the move.\n\nCarriers like Jet Airways and IndiGo feel that FDI above 24 per cent would make them susceptible to hostile takeovers in difficult financial situations. Ajit Singh, however, gave an assurance that there would be enough safeguards to take care of such concerns.\n\nUnder the current rules, up to 49 per cent FDI is allowed in aviation companies, but foreign airlines are not allowed to invest.

In the last nine years, the government of India has implemented several schemes aimed at addressing this pressing issue. However, despite these efforts, malnutrition remains a critical concern.Rashtriya Poshan Maah 2023 is harnessing the power of Jan Bhagidari through people\u2019s participation under various themes. Diverse activities like Swasth Balak Spardha, Anaemia camps, and Poshan Bhi Padhai Bhi registered a record number of activities just in a day on the Jan Andolan dashboard.Since the launch of POSHAN Abhiyaan in March 2018, the nation has embarked on nationwide Jan Andolans focused on nutrition for the very first time. These annual Jan Andolans under POSHAN Abhiyaan are carefully curated to promote behavioural changes, particularly as regards consumption of essential nutritious foods extending to the grassroots level. They are designed to target specific beneficiaries, namely pregnant women, lactating mothers, adolescent girls, and children up to 6 years of age.\n\nThe Jan Andolans is celebrated twice annually, during Poshan Maah in September and Poshan Pakhwada in March-April. To date, 10 Jan Andolans have been successfully celebrated (5 for each Maah and Pakhwada), recording more than 60 crore sensitization activities. This demonstrates the increasing and sustained participation across the country since 2018.\n\nCurrently, the nation is observing the 6th Rashtriya Poshan Maah, organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. This event demonstrates the strength of collaboration with various key ministries and departments for maximum outreach. In the first 12 days of these ongoing celebrations, over 6 crore activities have been registered on the Jan Andolan dashboard across the country.\n\nThroughout this month-long event, diverse stakeholders are actively participating to improve ground-level nutrition outcomes and encourage behavioural changes. Ministries such as Rural Development, Health & Family Welfare, and Panchayati Raj are leading, with the Ministry of Rural Development alone recording more than 6 lakh activities under Rashritya Poshan Maah 2023.\n\nThe current campaign is focusing on key themes, including exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding, Swasth Balak Spardha, growth measurement, and sensitization of tribal communities to millet, local food, and traditional food for addressing malnutrition challenges like anaemia, among others.\n\nIn terms of specific sensitization activities, the Swasth Balak Spardha/Growth measurement drive has registered the highest number of activities at 15 lakhs, followed by sensitization activities on growth monitoring and \u201cFood Resource Mapping\u201d within the village boundaries, which stand at close to 14 lakh activities. Additionally, anaemia camps for children, adolescent girls, and women in tribal districts recorded more than 12 lakh activities, with 11 lakh home visits focusing on ECCE, especially engaging parents.\n\nCollectively, through each Jan Andolan and its unique participatory sensitization activities, steady progress is being made towards making nutrition a part of Jan Bhagidari. Poshan Abhiyaan 2.0 aims at improving the nutritional status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Resting on the pillars of convergence, governance, and capacity building, Poshan 2.0 aims to contribute to the human capital development of the country, address challenges of malnutrition, promote nutrition awareness, develop good eating habits for sustainable health and well-being, and address nutrition-related deficiencies.\n\nPoshan Abhiyaan 2.0 aims to benefit approximately 11.80 crore children studying in 11.20 lakh schools nationwide. This initiative extends mid-day meals to Balvatika children, in addition to those in classes 1 to 8 in government and government-aided schools, aligning with the National Education Policy 2020. The scheme integrates Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and Women Self-Help Groups to champion the \u201cvocal for local\u201d philosophy, advancing the objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat, India\u2019s self-reliance initiative. To ensure the effective implementation of the National Nutrition Mission, social audits are made mandatory for every school in every district, engaging university and college students in field visits to monitor progress. Poshan Abhiyaan promotes the establishment of nutrition gardens in schools to provide additional micronutrients to students. It encourages schools to organise cooking competitions based on locally available vegetables. States are empowered to include supplementary items based on local needs, such as milk, fruits, or vegetables, with central approval, especially in regions with a high prevalence of anemia. Poshan Abhiyaan introduces \u201cTithi Bhojan,\u201d encouraging students from private schools to share their meals with underprivileged children at least once a month, fostering community participation and empathy.\n\nThe Modi government is providing free food grains to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next year. This initiative is set to improve access, affordability, and availability of entitled food grains for approximately 81 crore beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Importantly, it will alleviate the financial burden on the poorest of the poor, removing barriers to their access to nutritious food. The government\u2019s food subsidy expense for the next year under NFSA and other welfare schemes is expected to exceed INR 2 lakh crore ($24.5 billion), underscoring the significance of this commitment. Awareness-generation activities like the \u201cEat Right India\u201d campaign are implemented to promote healthy eating habits among schoolchildren and the wider community. This campaign emphasises the importance of eating healthy, safe, and sustainable food. In 2019, the Modi government launched the One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme, a citizen-centric and technology-driven initiative aimed at simplifying access to food. This innovative system facilitates the portability of ration cards within and across states, ensuring that families can access their entitled food grains regardless of their location. ONORC has already made strides in enhancing food and nutritional security for priority households.\n\nAs the Modi government is in its ninth year in office, the Poshan Abhiyan stands as a testament to its commitment to the well-being of women and children, demonstrating significant progress in the quest for holistic health and nutrition across the nation. The Modi government\u2019s commitment to addressing malnutrition through various schemes is commendable. However, the prevalence of malnutrition persists due to complex factors such as poverty, inadequate access to clean water, changing dietary patterns, and seasonal migrations. To effectively combat malnutrition, it is crucial to continue implementing and enhancing these schemes while simultaneously addressing the root causes of malnutrition. This includes efforts to alleviate poverty, improve sanitation and hygiene, promote healthy eating habits, and support traditional crop cultivation. A holistic approach that combines government initiatives with community involvement is essential to ensuring the health and well-being of India\u2019s children and women.\n\nThe Modi government recognizes the vital role nutrition plays in the lives of children and is committed to addressing malnutrition through various schemes and programs. These initiatives not only provide supplementary nutrition but also promote awareness about healthy eating habits and overall well-being. By focusing on the nutritional needs of children and ensuring access to balanced meals, India aims to secure a healthier and brighter future for its young citizens. These initiatives collectively contribute to the government\u2019s efforts to combat malnutrition and promote a culture of good nutrition and healthy living among children across the country.\n\nIndia\u2019s commitment to these initiatives is not only a testament to its dedication to its citizens but also a significant step towards fulfilling its global commitment under Sustainable Development Goal 2\u2014ensuring zero hunger. This commitment takes on added significance as the world grapples with food insecurity driven by global disruptions.\n\nSummary: India is observing the 6th Rashtriya Poshan Maah, a nationwide campaign aimed at addressing malnutrition among children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. The campaign, launched in 2018, has recorded over 60 crore sensitization activities across the country. The government has implemented various schemes, including POSHAN Abhiyaan, to promote nutrition awareness and healthy eating habits. The schemes aim to improve the nutritional status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and address malnutrition-related deficiencies. The government has also launched initiatives like the National Food Security Act, One Nation, One Ration Card, and Eat Right India campaign to ensure access to nutritious food and promote healthy eating habits. The Modi government's commitment to addressing malnutrition is commendable, but the prevalence of malnutrition persists due to complex factors. A holistic approach that combines government initiatives with community involvement is essential to ensuring the health and well-being of India's children and women.\n\n[DOC ",

This arbitrariness in UG medical admissions has resulted in seats being sold and purchased.\n\nThe MCI will prepare the course structure for the test and put it on the website for comments of people, said MCI BOG member DR Purushottam Lal.

While the government's proactive measures and the frontline workers' tireless efforts have helped tide the way, the pandemic has also brought forth the fragility of the healthcare system,\" the survey stated. On measures which can strengthen the healthcare and pharma sector, 67.3 per cent respondents expect the allocation of a fund to modernise existing primary healthcare infrastructure. \n\nThis was followed by an expectation (by 62.9 per cent) that the government should increase investments in creating new primary healthcare infrastructure. With regard to aspirations of individual taxpayers, 79.3 per cent respondents said they would like to see a cut in personal income tax rates, especially in the wake of pressure on their earnings in the pandemic-hit economy.\n\nWhile corporate tax rates have been reduced, individuals pay taxes at higher rates. Rationalising taxes for the individuals is critical as reducing the tax burden on individuals would enable further spending. According to the survey, this much-needed push to demand would help in creating a multiplier effect in the economy. \n\n\"A significant increase in the public expenditure is inevitable. The pandemic has taught us there are no choices other than large scale public investment in building primary health centres, hospitals at the district, state capital level,\" Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said.\n\nAs has been stated in the Economic Survey, there is a strong feeling within the government to raise public expenditure on healthcare three-fold from 1 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent of GDP, he added. \n\nSummary: The upcoming Indian Budget is expected to focus on the healthcare sector, with 39.7% of respondents in a survey expecting it to receive the highest priority. The survey also highlighted the need for modernising existing primary healthcare infrastructure and increasing investments in creating new infrastructure. Additionally, 79.3% of respondents wanted a cut in personal income tax rates.\n\n[DOC 2] The Indian Railways has announced that it will introduce a new train, the Vande Bharat Express, which will run between Mumbai and Delhi. The train will have a maximum speed of 160 kmph and will be equipped with advanced features such as automatic doors, LED lighting, and a high-speed internet connection.\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express will have 16 coaches, including two executive class coaches, and will have a seating capacity of 792 passengers. The train will also have a pantry car, which will offer a range of food and beverage options to passengers.\n\nThe train is expected to reduce travel time between Mumbai",

Manufacturing (14.7%), MSMEs (11.4%), real estate (10.7%), and infrastructure (9.6%) follow.\n\nThe pandemic exposed the fragility of the healthcare system, prompting 67.3% of respondents to call for modernization of primary healthcare infrastructure, and 62.9% to seek investments in new facilities. Additionally, 79.3% of respondents advocated for a reduction in personal income tax rates to ease financial strain and boost demand.\n\nAssocham Secretary General Deepak Sood emphasized the need for significant public investment in healthcare, echoing the Economic Survey\u2019s suggestion to increase healthcare spending from 1% to 3% of GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Banks as critical stakeholders in the financial ecosystem play an important role in formalising gold to ensure the integrity of the financial system,\u201d Choudhary said.\n\n\nAddressing the gathering, Dr  C Rangarajan, former Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and former RBI Governor, said: \u201cGold has been a tangible asset since ancient times, in all cultures and across all periods of history. While held as reserve by central banks, it no longer plays the role of intermediary in circulation. As the second largest consumer of gold, India accounts for one-fourth of the global demand. India\u2019s import of gold was 394 tons in 2000 and 774 tons in 2022 or $135 million. In 2022-23, gold imports accounted for 52.2 per cent of the current account deficit. The current level of import duty on gold is reasonable and is among the lowest.\u201d\n\n among commodities.\u201d\n\nSomasundaram P R, Regional CEO \u2013 India, World Gold Council, said: \u201cGold is a very good diversifier, it de-risks your portfolio and enables you to take more risk in other financial asset classes. India, as a gold consumer, can also be proud to have HUID technology through which every piece of jewellery hallmarked can be traced to its origins, which is aspirational in other markets.\u201d\n\nSuvanker Sen, Co-Chairman, National Council on Commodity Markets \u2013 ASSOCHAM, said: \u201cConsumer behaviour over the years in India has proven that we trust in gold. The various initiatives undertaken by all stakeholders has achieved a lot but a lot more can be done. The growth of the country is closely linked with the rise of gold as an asset. The 25,000 tons of gold that is embedded in our economy is one major driver.\u201d\n\nS C  Aggarwal, Senior Member, Managing Committee \u2013 ASSOCHAM, said: \u201cGold has multiple usage, as an ornament, it is a status symbol and an investment as well. India needs around 800 tons of gold every year necessitating imports which increases our trade deficit.\u201d\n\nSummary: India, as the second-largest buyer of gold in the world, can play a crucial role in the global economic order. Central banks, including the RBI, continue to hold gold reserves as a staple component of their overall reserves. India's import of gold was 394 tons in 2000 and 774 tons in 2022, accounting for 52.2% of the current account deficit. Experts believe that gold can be a diversifier, enabling investors to take more risk in other financial asset classes.\n\n[DOC 2] The Indian government has decided to increase the import duty on gold to 12.5% from the current 7.5% to curb the rising trade deficit and to boost domestic gold production.\n\nThe move is expected to increase the cost of gold for consumers and may lead to a decline in gold imports. The government has also decided to impose a 2% cess on gold imports to generate additional revenue.\n\nThe decision comes amid rising concerns over the country's trade deficit",

The study, reported in the New Scientist journal, believes it reflects insecurities among men who are not societys ideal height. The much-talked about short man syndrome is a phenomenon where short men compensate for their lack of height by inculcating aggressive tendencies, often associated with Napoleon, Mussolini, Hitler and Attila the Hun. In the study carried out by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, researchers asked men and women how jealous they were in their current relationships. In another similar study, involving 119 male and 230 female students, the participants were quizzed on their reaction if they saw their girlfriend, or boyfriend, flirting with a stranger.   The findings suggested that shorter men were far more likely to say they were jealous than taller ones. Taller men tended to be less jealous, and the tallest men were the least jealous, the Daily Mail quoted the researchers, led by Abraham Buunk, as saying. Among the women, average-sized females were the least jealous - while tall and short women were the most. Instead the findings showed they would be more jealous of taller women possessing masculine features such as physical dominance and social status.   Repeated studies have shown that women rate taller men as more attractive and powerful than shorter ones, while men prefer average women, usually who are a couple of inches shorter than them in height.   The experts said the animal kingdom illustrated this where larger males were likely to win fights and obtain dominance and monopolise access to females. They said in humans height was one of the first noticeable features and was therefore associated with status.\n\nSummary: A study by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands suggests that shorter men are more likely to be jealous in their relationships than taller men. The research found that shorter men were more likely to report feeling jealous when they saw their partner flirting with someone else, while taller men were less likely to feel jealous. The study also found that women, regardless of height, were more likely to feel jealous of taller women who possess masculine features such as physical dominance and social status.\n\n[DOC 2] NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways has decided to introduce a new system of booking tickets online, which will allow passengers to book tickets up to 120 days in advance.

In the next five years, all those who indulged in corruption will face legal action,\" he said. \u201cThe INDI alliance leaders, neck-deep in corruption, hold rallies, including in Delhi and Ranchi, voicing support for corrupt people, which reveals their true character,\u201d the PM said. Modi also blamed the Congress for the \u201cbackwardness\u201d of tribal districts, alleging that food grains used to rot in godowns during the UPA regime from 2004 to 2014, while tribal children died due to starvation. Modi said the NDA government ensured that the poor got access to the internet unlike the Congress, which was \u201cagainst\u201d it. \u201cToday's youths are the heroes of social media.

They are going against the views of Babasaheb Ambedkar and first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, neither of whom was in favour of reservations on religious lines,\" Modi claimed. He also slammed Tejashwi Yadav for bringing up the \"Hindu Muslim narrative\" at rallies while talking about the Agnipath scheme\u201d and said, \u201cWhen we talk about the martyrdom of Captain Hameed, do we think of him as a Muslim?\u201d Without referring to Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav by their names, he said, \"There is a shehzada in Delhi and one in Patna, both of whom think of the country as their jaagir (fiefdom).\" He added: \u201cTheir mindset was exposed when they raised questions about the surgical strikes and spoke ill of the armed forces.\" A large crowd cheered for the Prime Minister at the Kanpur roadshow in Uttar Pradesh. Mr Modi visited the Gumati Gurdwara before starting his roadshow in support of the BJP's candidates for the Kanpur and Akbarpur Lok Sabha seats.\n\n\nSummary: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed three rallies in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, criticizing the Congress-led UPA and the RJD for practicing appeasement politics. He accused Lalu Prasad Yadav of trying to save those responsible for the 2002 Godhra train arson.

If it continues to do so, we must strongly and promptly reciprocate\n\nTravelling across the US as the winter Olympics in Sochi commenced, one was saddened to witness how India\u2019s international credibility had been shaken, when television audiences across the world saw three forlorn Indian athletes marching without a national flag. India faced this disgrace thanks to the avariciousness and nepotism of an internationally disgraced Indian Olympic Association. Sadly, this was accompanied by charges of corruption, nepotism, match fixing and worse involving the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Many Indian friends in the US asked in anguish: \u201cIs there no section of national life left in India which is free from corruption and venalityIJ\u201d\n\nThe mood in Washington, where one had occasion to meet a wide cross-section of senior officials, business executives, analysts and scholars, was quite different. In marked contrast to earlier years, I found widespread criticism of the conduct of foreign and security policies by President Barack Obama. The Administration had not only botched up its healthcare programme, but was seen as indecisive and weak in dealing with challenges in West Asia, Afghanistan and the provocations of a jingoistic and militaristic China. President Obama, in turn, is acutely conscious of the mood in the country, which wants an end to foreign military entanglements.\n\nMore significantly, as the US moves towards becoming a net exporter of energy, thanks to expanding production of shale gas and oil, the country\u2019s geopolitics are set for profound changes. Using its leadership in areas of productivity and innovation, the US now appears set to the stage for increasing domination of the world economic order. From across its eastern shores, the US is negotiating a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership with its European allies. Across its western shores in the Pacific, the Americans are negotiating a Transpacific Partnership, with Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam as negotiating partners. While China has informally indicated an interest in joining this partnership, the US will use its influence to ensure that China is not admitted till American political and economic pre-conditions are met.\n\nThere is naturally interest in Washington in the forthcoming general election in India. The assessment appears to be that the ruling Congress is headed for a drubbing in the poll. Not many tears will be shed in Washington or elsewhere about this inevitability, as the only questions which well-wishers of India ask are how India landed itself in its present morass of corruption and whether a new dispensation, which may be fractious, will be able to restore India to a high growth path.  Speaking informally, a senior Administration official recalled that President Obama had described the US-India partnership as \u201cone of the defining partnerships of the world\u201d. The official noted that \u201cevery meaningful partnership between powerful nations encounters setbacks\u201d, adding that such setbacks should be minor compared to the benefits of the relationship and the magnitude of what the two could accomplish together.\n\nThe Khobragade episode was a defining event in India-US relations. The Americans found Indians across the political spectrum united in the view that insults to India\u2019s national dignity would not be acceptable. It is important that in future negotiations by the task force set up to address such issues, India should make it clear that it will not tolerate events like Ms Sonia Gandhi being threatened with prosecution while undergoing medical treatment in New York, or the supercilious attitude adopted towards Mr Narendra Modi, who is a constitutionally-elected Chief Minister. We should not accept a situation where Americans believe that they can behave high-handedly towards our elected politicians because of their domestic lobbies. The US should also be left in no doubt that on such issues, including consular and diplomatic privileges, India will firmly adhere to a policy of strict reciprocity.\n\nThe Obama Administration has messed up its relations with Mr Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan, dealing with him in a manner that showed scant regard for his position as the elected head of state of Afghanistan. Worse still, by its actions, the US has clearly given the impression that despite its protestations it was clandestinely dealing, behind Mr Karzai\u2019s back, with the Taliban. While the US-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership speaks of joint determination in eliminating the \u2018Al Qaeda and its affiliates\u2019, the US now speaks only of eliminating the Al Qaeda and not is affiliates like the Taliban, the Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, the lashkar-e-Tayyeba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed. There are naturally concerns in Afghanistan that the US, which needs Pakistan\u2019s assistance for withdrawing its military equipment from Afghanistan, will seek to appease them by giving them a less than healthy role in determining the future dispensation in Afghanistan and the role of the Taliban in such a dispensation.\n\nWhile there is an evident congruence of interests in working with the US, Japan and others in the face of growing Chinese military assertiveness, New Delhi and Tokyo cannot ignore the reality that there have been many flip flops and inconsistencies in the approach of the Obama Administration to China. Moreover, the US is becoming increasingly strident in its economic relations with India on issues ranging from sanctions on sections of our Pharmaceutical industry and our Civil Aviation facilities, while demanding changes in our policies on solar panels and equipment and placing restrictions on the movement of IT personnel. It is, however, not India alone that is the recipient of such measures from the US!\n\nDespite these challenges, India cannot ignore the reality that the US is the pre-eminent power in world. Moreover, it will remain so in coming years, primarily because its innovative and technological strengths are going to be reinforced by its energy surpluses, together with the energy potential of its neighbours like Canada, Mexico and Argentina. It will, moreover, remain the foremost power in the manufacture of high-tech equipment, particularly in defence and aerospace. It is for India to fashion industrial policies to leverage its strengths and potential to secure high levels of investment and partnership in crucial high-tech industries. I was advised in Washington that contracts currently secured with US companies enable us to import 5.8 million metric tonnes per annum of shale gas from the US annually from 1917. According to oil industry sources these contracts alone provides us more gas than we could obtain from the controversial Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline. But, for all this to fructify, the new dispensation in New Delhi will have to replace economic populism and accompanying fiscal irresponsibility, with a quest for accelerated growth.\n\nSummary: The article discusses the author's observations during a trip to the US, where he witnessed widespread criticism of the Obama Administration's foreign and security policies. The author notes that the US is shifting its focus towards becoming a net exporter of energy, which will have profound implications for its geopolitics. The article also touches upon the forthcoming general election in India, with the author noting that the ruling Congress is likely to face a drubbing. The author emphasizes the importance of India's relations with the US, but also notes that India must stand firm on issues of national dignity and not tolerate high-handed behavior from the US. The article concludes by highlighting the need for India to fashion industrial policies to leverage its strengths and potential to secure high levels of investment and partnership in crucial high-tech industries.\n\n[DOC 2] The Indian government has decided to set up a new agency to monitor and regulate the functioning of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).

Once operational, this indigenous system will significantly reduce India\u2019s dependence on satellite navigation systems (commonly known as SatNav systems) that are run by other countries \u2014 primarily the US and its Global Positioning System. America's GPS currently supports India's existing SatNav system, Gagan (GPS-Aided GEO Augmented Navigation). Gagan mostly caters to space scientists and the commercial aviation industry but IRNSS will have a wider user-base and, importantly, will function independently; though, of course, it will still be compatible with the GPS as well as with Russia's Global Navigation Satellite System (known as Glonass). The purpose of a SatNav system is to accurately track the location or positioning of an object. This object can be anything \u2014 a vehicle, an individual, a delivery package, a mobile phone or even a bird or an animal fitted with a receiver and transmitter. Today, SatNav systems are integral to a wide variety of activities. Some of them are as basic as the use of the Google Maps application on our phones and some much more complex such as the technology used to navigate our mass transit systems, be they under-ground, on land, over water or in the air. SatNav systems also play an important role in emergency services, disaster management and help with weather forecasting; they are used for geological surveys and mapping activities, in archaeological studies as well as for photographic geo-coding. Increasingly, SatNav systems are also being used for social networking. This list can go on but it should suffice to say that SatNav systems underline just about every activity in our daily lives and, given that this trend will only grow stronger in the days to come, it is the fitness of things that India has developed its own SatNav system.\n\nSummary: India has launched its indigenous satellite navigation system, IRNSS, which will reduce the country's dependence on foreign SatNav systems like GPS.

The investments are mainly financed out of savings of masses. Given the importance of savings, the Government from time-to-time provides various incentives for promoting the domestic household savings. In India, the saving behavior of the people is largely motivated by the tax incentives or benefits attached to any saving instrument. Any instrument of saving/investment scheme has three stages of life, which are (a) Investment stage (b) Accumulation or Earning stage and (c) Withdrawal stage. The Government provides tax incentives or benefits at any or each stage of the saving instrument, depending upon its policy. Pre-Budget: Tax CalculatorPost-Budget: Tax CalculatorAt the investment stage, the tax benefits are provided by giving deduction of the amount saved or invested from the total taxable income of the individual. For example, the amount invested in Public Provident Fund (PPF) account is eligible for deduction from the total taxable income of an individual, subject to certain limits. At the earning stage, the benefits are provided by tax exempting the income earned on the savings or investment. For example, interest earned or accrued to the credit of PPF balance amount is exempt from tax. At the withdrawal stage, the benefits are provided by not taxing the accumulated amount of principal, interest earned and bonus, if any, at the time of maturity or withdrawal of the saving instrument or investment. For example, the amount withdrawn from PPF account on maturity is not taxable. Therefore, PPF is out of the tax net throughout its life cycle viz. investment, earning and withdrawal and is exempt-exempt-exempt (popularly known as EEE) at each stage. It is pertinent to note here that the Government may, according to its tax policy, tax any instrument of investment or saving at any stage i.e. either at investment, earning or at withdrawal stage. If any savings instrument is taxed at the withdrawal stage, it falls under the EET (i.e. Exempt- Exempt- Tax) scheme of taxation. In other words, under the EET regime, saving instruments are taxed neither at investment stage nor at earning stage but are taxed at the withdrawal stage. Therefore, every instrument of savings can be classified under permutation-combinations of EEE, EET, ETE, TEE, TTE or ETT according to the stage of taxability. Going forward, the Government is planning to rationalise the domestic savings environment by introducing the tax provisions for specified savings instruments, which are currently under EEE regime and hence, is proposing to tax the savings instruments at least at one stage, i.e. either at earning stage or at withdrawal stage. As discussed above, the tax policy of the country hugely affects the saving decision of the people. The transition of savings instruments from EEE regime to EET regime would have a significant impact on the saving behavior of population at large. It would change the investment choice and preference amongst the taxpayers. Under EET regime, the amount invested including interest, dividend, bonus, capital appreciation or any other form of return by whatever name called will be subject to tax at the time of actual receipt. The amount of withdrawal from long-term savings instruments likes Employee Provident Fund (EPF), PPF, Government Provident Fund (GPF) and so on which are currently out of tax net, will become taxable. The major impact of shift in taxation from EEE regime to EET regime will be on long term investment planning of the individual. From social security point of view, this will result in huge financial hit on the funds of the retiring population of the country who have invested their fortune in long term investment funds under EEE regime. Considering the savings and investments environment of the country, it would be better, if the new regime of EET is introduced for new investments and savings made on or after the introduction of new EET regime. This would also enable the institutions in prescribing the new regime in more efficient manner. If the existing savings and investments instruments are taxed prospectively from the day EET taxation is introduced, there may be difficulty in distinguishing the investment and accumulations under EEE regime and EET regime, in allocation of incomes accruing in respect of old contributions/accumulations and fresh investments/deposits, the manner of treating the withdrawals viz. whether on FIFO or LIFO basis to be adopted for identifying the withdrawals made out of investments/deposits. Therefore, there is a need for due caution to be exercised, while deciding the modalities of introducing the EET regime of taxation, so that the financial well being of the investors of this country is maintained. (Views expressed are personal)Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy\n\nSummary: The article discusses the importance of savings and investments in an economy and how the government provides tax incentives to promote domestic household savings. It highlights the three stages of a saving instrument's life cycle and how the government provides tax benefits at each stage. The article also discusses the impact of shifting from an EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) regime to an EET (Exempt-Exempt-Tax) regime, which would make long-term savings instruments taxable.

An edited excerpt:\n\nThe 1970s saw the rise of trade unionism and advocacy movements for civil liberties, especially after the clamping of emergency by Mrs. Indira Gandhi in 1975. Further, in 1974 a document was prepared on the Status of Women by the official Status of Women Commission, titled \u2018Towards Equality.\u2019 It focused attention on the fact that, despite many progressive social legislations and constitutional guarantees, women\u2019s status in India had indeed not improved much, especially in many areas like political, economic and social spheres. This document has been the basis for many legislations and development programs focusing on gender as well as creation of women\u2019s organizations and working groups \u2014 as discussed later. The United Nations declared 1975 as the International Year for women and 8 March as the International Day for Women.\n\nThe last 70+ years of independence has seen many organizations springing up that have espoused the cause of women, both in the cities and at grassroots level. Domestic violence, alcoholism, female feticide, sexual harassment of women at work place, skewed and unjust family laws, reproductive rights, legislative reforms are some of the issues spearheaded by civil society organizations and NGOs. On the academic front, many universities in the 1970s set up Women Studies\u2019 centres.\n\nA pioneer in Women\u2019s studies, Dr. Vina Mazumdar was the first one in the independent India to combine activism with scholarly research in women\u2019s studies.\n\nVina Mazumdar [1994] argues that women became a point of engagement in politics as well as research and academia during the colonial rule with an objective to justify both social reform or to give a backbone for India\u2019s cultural pride. She writes that this however, became redundant in post-independent India, as the need for justification was no longer necessary. This may have in some way led to the side-lining of women\u2019s issue and with that the increase in gender disparity between men and women. This gap was highlighted in the investigation by the Committee on the Status of Women in India and the subsequent report \u2018Towards Equality\u2019 1975. With this, a new agenda was set to change the status of women and for that research on women\u2019s issue was one area, which received the impetus. A new program for Women\u2019s Studies, initiated by the ICSSR began which, over the years has seen a lot of seminal work in this arena. This went along with several other processes of bringing about change and empowerment as the larger women\u2019s movement also went along. Critics however, feel that in the beginning, there was a lot of academia \u2014 civil society interface, which over the years, has eroded.\n\nMany UN organizations like the UNICEF, UNFPO and UNESCO have also entered the policy dialogue with the government based on milestones articulated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) of which India is a signatory.\n\nEqual Rights and Opportunities Guaranteed by Constitution of India\n\nThe Constitution of India provides equal status and opportunities to women along with men. The Indian women received equal political rights for which their western counterparts had to fight a long battle.\n\nWomen-Centric Laws\n\nSince the country\u2019s independence in 1947, many laws have been passed to address the issues of equal opportunities for women at work place and home to address issues of sexual harassment at work place, domestic violence, dowry, and female infanticide, and feticide, property rights among others. Discrimination, however, is so well entrenched in the patriarchal mind-set of the society coupled with ignorance and centuries of subjugation that both the urban and the rural women endure (particularly the latter as they suffer in larger measure in every possible way) when it comes to equality. Women, especially in the rural arena are raped and wronged to settle caste rivalries. Young women choosing to wed out of caste and religion often become victims of honour killing. Who they can marry, what they would wear, how they would behave are sometime issues discussed in the illegal Khap panchayats, while the state administration is often seen as a mute spectator.\n\nThe passing of the two acts viz. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prohibition), 2013, and the Indecent Portrayal of Women in Media (Prohibition), 1986, together with many other acts including against those against domestic violence, dowry, and sex determination as well as the setting up of the National Commission for Women (NCW) at the centre and other state level commissions are pointers to the efforts by myriad women rights organizations in influencing policy and also various governments in addressing women issues.\n\nHaving said that, there is no gain saying that there are laws in place but it is the implementation, which is more often lax. Social transformation accompanied with implementation of laws shall be the key to address women related issues in India. The feminist literature and movements bear testimony to the fact that feminism is very much home grown and organic in India and not a copy of the West as generally alleged. The feminist movement is not against men but about fighting the power structures that are so well embedded in the familial, social, political and economic spheres.\n\nSummary: The article discusses the stereotyping and objectification of women in the media narrative, which needs to be addressed. It highlights the progress made in women's rights in India, including the establishment of women's studies centers, the passing of laws to address women's issues, and the setting up of the National Commission for Women. However, it also notes that despite these efforts, gender disparity remains a significant issue in India, and that the implementation of laws is often lax.\n\n[DOC 2] The Indian government has launched a new initiative to promote women's empowerment and gender equality. The initiative, called \"Nari Shakti\" (Women's Strength), aims to promote women's participation in the workforce, reduce gender-based violence, and increase access to education and healthcare for women.\n\nThe initiative is being implemented through a range of programs and initiatives, including:\n\n* The \"Nari Shakti\" scholarship program, which provides financial assistance to women pursuing higher education\n* The \"Nari Shakt",

The author, Jaishri Jethwaney, notes that the 1970s saw the rise of trade unionism and advocacy movements for civil liberties, including the Status of Women Commission's report \"Towards Equality\" in 1975. This document highlighted the lack of improvement in women's status in India despite progressive social legislations and constitutional guarantees.\nThe article also discusses the growth of women's studies centers in universities and the work of pioneers like Dr. Vina Mazumdar, who combined activism with scholarly research. The author argues that the need to justify women's issues in colonial India led to their sidelining in post-independent India, resulting in increased gender disparity.\nThe article highlights the importance of equal rights and opportunities guaranteed by the Constitution of India and the various laws passed to address women's issues, such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, and property rights. However, it also notes that discrimination and ignorance are deeply entrenched in the patriarchal mindset, leading to continued subjugation of women, particularly in rural areas.\nThe author concludes that social transformation accompanied by the implementation of laws is key to addressing women-related issues in India. The feminist movement is not against men but about fighting power structures embedded in familial, social, political, and economic spheres."

Like their brothers Prakash and Ashok, they are the descendants of Parmanand Hinduja who created the family fortune by founding an astute trading business between India and Iran.\n\nAlthough surrounded by a tightly knit group of loyal friends, Srichand and Gopichand have in recent years kept a low profile, ever since it was revealed in 2001 that former Labour minister Peter Mandelson had contacted the Home Office to inquire about one of the brother's application for British citizenship.\n\nThe British media's focus on their lives intensified after it subsequently turned out that another Labour minister, Keith Vaz, had made even more energetic inquiries about their passport applications. Questions were also raised about why the Hinduja Foundation had made payments to a company run by Vaz's wife.\n\nElizabeth Filkin, the UK's Parliamentary commissioner for Standards at the time, conceded that the money had been given for legal advice on immigration issues and that Vaz himself had gained no direct financial benefit, but she was critical of the secrecy surrounding the Vaz-Hinduja connection. She said at the time: \"It is clear to me there has been deliberate collusion over many months between Vaz and his wife to conceal this fact and to prevent me from obtaining accurate information about his possible financial relationship with the Hinduja family\".\n\nThese and other related issues now seem to belong to another age as the Hinduja brothers prepare to move into their four renovated properties on Carlton House Terrace, designed by John Nash and commissioned by King George IV in 1820, where they will be neighbours of the British Foreign Secretary and the Foreign Press Club.\n\nTheir new London residence is the Delhi equivalent of moving into a refurbished property on Tughlaq Road or Aurangzeb Road. They are said to have paid some \u00a360 million for the property, which is more than what Lakshmi Mittal, Britain's richest man and also an Indian, paid for his home in Kensington Palace Gardens in another part of London.\n\nAt their new home, the Hindujas will be a stone's throw from Trafalgar Square and a short walk from Buckingham Palace. A swimming pool and private cinema are part of the palatial new home which is made up of some 50 rooms over six floors.\n\nBut there are other luxurious touches as well, including marble floors, gold leaf and elephant motifs, which prompted a director of English Heritage to comment: \"I can't think of another domestic restoration project on this scale with buildings of this importance.

A 36-year-wait ended for Argentina on Sunday night in the most thrilling of finals. And as he walked in front of his team mates in regal robes, kissing the trophy and holding it aloft, no longer would Messi be a step behind Diego Maradona. Doha had brought them level after a tournament where, watched by the world and facing intense pressure, Messi was as inspirational as Maradona was in 1986.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy, just as it hadn\u2019t been for Maradona in that 1986 final when Germany had drawn level from 2-0 down.\n\nOn Sunday, 2-0 to 2-2 in 97 seconds meant Argentina, who were sauntering to their third World Cup title \u2014 and the first since that magical night at Mexico \u201886 \u2014 had to do it all over again. So they did through who else but Lionel Messi. When Kylian Mbappe shot France back in contention with that two-goal burst, Messi had to respond. And when he scored again, deep into extra time to seal it for a second time, Mbappe hit back by becoming the first player since Geoff Hurst in 1966 to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final.\n\nIn the tie-breaker \u2014 in which both Messi and Mbappe scored \u2014 the hand of Emiliano Martinez gave Argentina the title for what seemed like the third time in one night.\n\nCue hugs. Cue song. Cue chants. Cue tears. And Cue Sergio Aguero flying down the stands to envelop Messi. Having cried after scoring and again when France drew level, Angel di Maria, whose goal had fetched Argentina the Copa America in 2021, could now weep in joy.\n\nSunday seemed a slow day, the build-up to the final usually is. 63 of the games were done and everybody needed to catch their breath before the big one. As it is, the World Cup has throbbed only in parts of Doha, never the whole. All day, areas near the Qatar National Library, the residential blocks in Al Sadd and even the main media centre, usually buzzing with thousands of journalists, looked like it was sleeping in late on a Sunday. Which being Qatar\u2019s National Day, was a holiday.\n\nIt changed as you got nearer to the Lusail. By early evening, all roads leading to it were clogged, a coach ferrying media to the stadium got lost and suddenly things began to get hectic. The Lusail, lit and golden, was like a giant beehive to which everyone flocked. In Argentina shirts, in those of France and some waving flags of Qatar too.\n\nThe closing ceremony was a \u201cmashup\u201d, in FIFA\u2019s words, of songs we heard through the past 29 days. It was called \u201cA Night To Remember,\u201d but was really a prelude to an unforgettable night.\n\nEverything, from Deepika Padukone and Iker Casillas accompanying the 6.175kg trophy that travels in a designer bag to Messi\u2019s brief hug with Antoine Griezmann, the warm-ups and the lung-bursting rendition of national anthems were that: a prelude to a memorable night.\n\nIt was difficult to say who among Messi or Mbappe got the louder cheer when the teams were being announced but there was no doubting that in the 23rd minute.\n\nThat was when Martinez could again look at the game after kissing a post and when Lautaro Martinez would fist his appreciation into the substitute\u2019s bench.\n\nThat was also when Messi had converted the penalty kick with a placement that sent Hugo Lloris the wrong way. The roar that followed, as Messi found himself at the bottom of a players\u2019 pile, would have reached the moon.\n\nOne section of the Lusail bounced like it was on a trampoline. It was the same section, behind Martinez\u2019s goal, that was roaring \u201cArgentina, Argentina\u201d when Di Maria made it 2-0 ending a sweeping move that had Argentina swiftly moving the ball from the right edge of their penalty area to the left edge of France\u2019s. The defending champions, usually so clinical in their approach to games, were being bossed.\n\nTill Didier Deschamps decided to make first-half substitutions getting in Marcus Thuram and Randal Kolo Muani. Like most of Doha, France woke up late but their stirring comeback produced a final for the ages.\n\nNeither deserved to lose, neither did in open play. Say your thank yous in whatever language you want, these two sets of gladiators deserve nothing but our appreciation.\n\nSummary: Argentina won the FIFA World Cup 2022, defeating France 4-2 in the final. Lionel Messi scored twice, including the winning goal in extra time, to secure his first World Cup title. The match was a thrilling comeback, with France drawing level twice before Argentina won the tiebreaker.\n\n[DOC 2] The Indian government has announced a new policy to promote the use of electric vehicles (EVs) in the country.

The scientists also found that the region was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than during the 20th century. The team of scientists led by the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Germany, reconstructed the temperature from a set of ice cores, unprecedented in length and quality, of the past 1,000 years, which revealed that today\u2019s warming in central-north Greenland is surprisingly pronounced. They also measured the melt production rate of the ice sheet, the study said. The Greenland Ice Sheet plays a pivotal part in the global climate system. With enormous amounts of water stored in the ice, about 3 million cubic kilometres, melt and resulting sea-level rise is considered a potential tipping point. For unmitigated global emissions rates, or \u2018business as usual\u2019 scenario, the ice sheet is projected to contribute up to 50 centimetres to global mean sea level by 2100, the study published in the journal Nature said. Weather stations along the coast have been recording rising temperatures for many years. In a study now published in the journal Nature, experts from the institute present clear evidence that the effects of global warming have reached the remote, high-elevation areas of central-north Greenland. \u201cThe time series we recovered from ice cores now continuously covers more than 1,000 years, from the year 1000 to 2011. This data shows that the warming from 2001 to 2011 clearly differs from natural variations during the past 1,000 years. Although grimly expected in the light of global warming, we were surprised by how evident this difference really was,\u201d said AWI glaciologist Maria H\u00f6rhold, lead author of the study. Together with colleagues from AWI and the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Niels Bohr Institute, she analysed the isotope composition in shallow ice cores gathered in central-north Greenland during dedicated AWI expeditions, the study said. Previous ice cores obtained at co-located sites starting in the 1990s did not indicate clear warming in central-north Greenland, despite rising global mean temperatures. Part of the reason is substantial natural climate variability in the region, the study said.\n\nSummary: Scientists have found that the years 2001 to 2011 were the warmest in the last thousand years at high elevations of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Here's what we know about the new feature.\nElon Musk's company, xAI, has provided more insight into an upcoming feature for its AI-powered chatbot, Grok, known as \"Unhinged Mode.\" The feature, teased last April, is expected to deliver responses that could be deemed objectionable or offensive, as outlined on an updated FAQ page on xAI's website. The mode will be designed to generate content that is similar to an amateur stand-up comedian still finding its voice, according to reports.

When the chatbot was introduced two years ago, Musk described it as edgy, unfiltered, and willing to answer controversial questions that other AI systems avoid. While Grok has met some of those expectations by producing vulgar content when prompted, it still maintains certain limits.

He promised to work on steering Grok toward a more politically neutral stance, referencing the overwhelming presence of \"woke nonsense\" on the internet.

We saw a strong quarter driven by revenues growth for the major mobile products segment, from $1.9 billion to $1.9 billion in the quarter. The growth in the mobile-phone segment was strong. Sales of the desktop segment grew at more than 2 percent, along with the PC segment due to a number of strong business segments. The desktop segment will stay strong as well and will increase in quality in the mobile-business segment.\n\nIn Q1, we saw some strong growth in revenue and revenues for third quarter 2015, compared with the same times last year. In Q2, we saw higher revenues and the same year-over-year sales growth for the mobile-telephone segment as we saw in Q1, we believe a combination of business moves and a lot of performance enhancements will help us to maintain our Q2 revenue and revenues. We are pleased around the Q2 quarter as the revenues from third quarter 2015 was much higher than in Q1.\n\nThe main driver driving Q2 is the strong growth in our mobile-phone business from the quarter ended June 30, 2015, to the $1.3 billion we see in 2014. In our Q3 quarters, we have been able to capture a high proportion of our mobile-phone customers by adding to our mobile-device share as well. The Mobile-tablet segment added $4.8 billion of revenue to the revenue of the third quarter of 2015, and our smartphone-device share grew well in the quarter to $5.6 billion. The mobile-phone segment now sees a strong quarter driven by significant expansion of our mobile-phone business on both handsets. It continues to deliver revenue on the highest-margin phones and includes the highest-margin tablets. If we add to our mobile-phone business at the same pace as the growth of our tablet business, we will see higher sales and further increase in our mobile-device share.\n\nAs our main drivers for growth are the growth in our tablet business in Japan, we expect that both sales growth and Q3 earnings are strong for the quarter. In Q3 quarters, we sold more tablet units in Japan than we ever did before. We did see a few high-end devices in the quarter, but we will now add additional devices in all parts of the country in Q3.\n\nIn Q2, we saw high sales of new devices in Japan. In this quarter, we saw better iPad sales with $1.1 billion in sales. On the other hand, we did see sales for the second quarter of 2016. We believe these changes will provide more value to our customers and, if we add more to our tablet and smartphone business, we may see an additional revenue share for Q3.\n\nWe are also working on an internal plan to add more technology to our network to increase our customers. In Q2, we will continue our partnership with Samsung on the world's largest tablet business. We believe that we're a great partner in the global smartphone business and that we are a great example of a technology company. To enhance our efforts in our business plan we are working with several partners, including Qualcomm and Alcatel-Lucent that are our key partners in the network hardware business.\n\nOur mobile business is now performing quite well as shown at our Q2 earnings. This quarter we have introduced a new operating system and enhanced internal and external call center, with new software that has a potential to enhance our mobile-phone experience, and improvements to be made to our mobile-communications services. We continue to increase our user base at home and our mobile-mobile business is now seeing very strong growth. More phones are coming, and we will see more growth, particularly in the second half of the year, as the demand for smartphones for both the home and business environment improves and this brings more devices from the home.\n\nFinally, I want to highlight that we have implemented a number of new initiatives with our Mobile Device portfolio. For example, we were able to deliver new mobile products on the iPad 3 (in Japan) to our more than 10 million customers. The company currently has 10 million mobile phones, and we are now ready to bring in the first generation of all the devices.\n\nOverall, Q3 2016 saw a strong sales year of $1.7 billion in Q2. Sales of the second quarter of 2016 have been impressive, and I expect this to continue through Q3. On the other hand, that year was a lot of sales growth where we saw a lot of growth in tablets of a certain size or in devices with fewer buttons, especially in some markets where it was just under $3 billion.\n\nWhat do you expect at our next GAAP release next week?\n\nSummary: The company reported strong Q3 earnings, driven by revenue growth in the mobile products segment, with sales of desktop and PC segments also growing. The mobile-phone segment saw significant expansion, with the company capturing a high proportion of mobile-phone customers. The company also introduced new operating systems and enhanced internal and external call centers to improve the mobile-phone experience. The company expects strong sales growth in Q3 and Q4, driven by the growth of the mobile-phone business.\n\n[DOC 2] India's GDP growth rate: The Indian economy has been growing at a rate of 7.3% in the last quarter, according to the latest data released by the Reserve Bank of India.

Almost eight months after the registration of the case, in which the 24-year-old star kid spent 26 days in custody, the narcotics control bureau has given him and five other accused persons a clean chit.\n\nThe special investigation team of the NCB on Friday filed a 6,000-page charge sheet naming 14 accused. The agency said that the names of six persons, who were made accused by the earlier investigating team, including Aryan, Avin Sahu, Gopal Anand, Samir Sehgal, Bhaskar Arora and Manav Singhal have been dropped from the charge sheet for the \u201clack of sufficient evidence\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, deputy director general Sanjay Kumar Singh of the NCB said, \u201cSIT carried out an investigation in an objective manner.

The team arrested several people including Aryan from the ship. Though the investigators did not recover any drugs from Aryan\u2019s position, they allegedly recovered six grams of charas from Merchant and five grams of hashish from Dhamecha.\n\nAryan was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 28 last year.

The performance looks at the female performer\u2019s body as a site of protest.\n\nThe play, a powerful one-woman physical theatre, performed at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) on Saturday, draws from the lives of urban characters who speak similar languages of consumerism and technology.\n\nDaily annoyances\nIt deals with daily annoyances of being a woman in the country.\n\nMasculinity in South Asia, especially India, is asserted and celebrated widely, says Deepika. \u201cIts conventional manifestations are varied and dangerous, infecting different aspects of everyday life. Whether through the perpetration of rape culture in cinema and politics, or the palpable anxiety of the female body on the street, masculinity occupies oppressively large spaces, literally and figuratively,\u201d she says.\n\nSubverting masculinity\nNo Rest in the Kingdom has been created out of the desire to embody and subvert expressions of this masculinity through the body of a female performer, she says.\n\nThe kingdom is the current society where we live, where women are subjected to daily discrimination and violence.\n\nBlurring the boundaries of genders, the actor embodies a variety of characters \u2014 male, female and feline \u2014 representing a gender and inter-species fluidity. The cat is a powerful motif that runs through the play.\n\nHow might her body, alone and vulnerable, serve as a metaphor for gender insensitivity and antagonism? How can her body transform into multiple sites of protest and how can humour, irreverence, and playfulness become her primary weapons of dissent and opposition?\n\nThis show has travelled to find resonance in different countries because its characters are archetypes of \u2018masculinity\u2019 familiar across cultures.\n\nThe play causes discomfort, sometimes scepticism.

Together with UN agencies in the country, they are discussing a plan of action.\n\nThe UN Resident Co-ordinator, Elena Panova said the plan included country level co-ordination, risk communication, case investigation, laboratory diagnostics and other measures.\n\nWhen asked whether the UN trusted the official figures showing Turkmenistan had no confirmed Covid-19 cases, Panova avoided giving a straight answer.\n\n\"We are relying on official information because this is what all countries are doing,\" she said.\n\n\"There is no question of trust because that's the way it works.\"\n\nPanova said early measures on restricting travel might have contributed to lack of confirmed cases.\n\nTurkmenistan closed most of its land border crossings more than a month ago.

(His official 4 Rajaji Marg residence is under renovation.) His twin Dachshunds, Dash and Tickle, shoot around like little guided torpedoes clad in identical red-and- black-trimmed winter fleece. Staff officers and Tavor rifle-wielding bodyguards of the special forces flank the fleet of black armoured Scorpios waiting to make the short two km drive to his office deep within the sandstone corridors of South Block. The general appears in the verandah of his home, proffers a firm handshake. He's of medium height, stockily built, with salt and pepper hair and a neatly trimmed white moustache. He listens carefully, looks you in the eye when he speaks, and the clearly articulated sentences are delivered like a military drum roll. He clearly plays on the front foot. There is simply no question that will induce any hesitation on his part, from tackling China and Pakistan, surgical strikes, the controversial Cold Start war doctrine to the polemic around his selection as army chief, superseding two senior army commanders. As he sat down for an extensive interview with Executive Editor Sandeep Unnithan, General Rawat revealed why he was supremely confident of navigating the minefield that lies ahead in his three-year tenure. Excerpts:What do you see as your main security challenges and how do you plan to handle developments like the reorganisation of China's armed forces?The primary role of the armed forces is the defence of the borders, preparation for conventional warfare, maintaining internal security and focusing on disaster relief. We are studying the restructuring of the PLA to see its efficacy. We will study their reforms and see whether they have relevance in our context. If so, we will put them across with modifications to the government.The army's China-specific Mountain Strike Corps has been languishing for want of funds. Is this relevant in our context?We raised the Mountain Strike Corps (MSC) as part of a transition from dissuasion and deterrence to credible deterrence. All adversaries respect credible strength, which comes from such formations capable of striking across the border. We are expected to remain defensive in order to ensure there are no incursions and the sanctity of the borders is maintained. But you cannot always remain defensive. We must also have the capability to conduct offensive operations. Whether these forces are going to be used physically will depend on the situation, but surely these forces meet the purpose of credible deterrence. So, we'll certainly give impetus to raising the corps. The government has given us permission to induct manpower, infrastructure development along the border is taking place, weapons and equipment are coming in.Did the army's September 29, 2016 surgical strikes define our new red lines in a strong response to a high-casualty attack by terrorists?All nations and armies define their own thresholds. The December 13, 2001 Parliament attack was a threshold. In a terrorist attack, it is the nature of the attack and the success the terrorists are able to achieve-sometimes what happens is that the terrorists get success because of incidental damage caused. Uri, for example, was an incidental success because there were troops in tents, troops who were grouped together. In Nagrota, they did not get so much success, they did not get so many people, we were able to eliminate them before they could do damage. So the threshold level will vary and [determine] the kind of reaction, because our nation is not a warmongering nation. We want peace and tranquility, and if we find that something can be resolved through negotiations, an attempt is always made to resolve it through negotiations but if we find these incidents getting repeated, we define a threshold, a decision is taken, recommendations are made, and we will go across again. It is very difficult to say if there are red lines (in response to terrorist attacks). What I can say is that there are dotted lines, and those dots are then joined together by us to draw a red line.Is the Cold Start doctrine-instituted after Operation Parakram in 2001-still an option in response to attacks like the one on Parliament in 2001 or 26/11 in Mumbai?The Cold Start doctrine exists for conventional military operations. Whether we have to conduct conventional operations for such strikes is a decision well-thought through, involving the government and the Cabinet Committee on Security.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, in the combined commanders' conference in 2015, said that future conflicts will become shorter, and wars will become rare. Do you have any strategy for short, intense wars?In our case, we prepare for short, intense conflicts, and at the same time have to be prepared for wars becoming long-drawn. Based on that, we have a well-defined strategy. What the PM said is right; wars will be intense and short because there'll always be international pressure in wars between two nations. We have to be aware of that; whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready and have to achieve success.The modernisation of the Indian Army has been an area of major concern for you and your predecessors. Have you identified any key areas for delivery during your tenure?Technology is constantly changing. You cannot be using older technologies for your weapons systems and equipment. My thinking is that you have to look at emerging technology because of the time it takes for a weapons system to be inducted into the armed forces. So you have to look at tomorrow's technology for inducting weapons. With that in mind, we have also focused on certain weapons systems. Infantry is the most affected-deployed along the border round the clock, in internal security situations, and in the face of frequent ceasefire violations on the border-we need to give them modern weapons technology best suited to such an environment. The mechanised forces need future battle tanks and Infantry Combat Vehicles, new aviation assets, air defence systems, artillery and other longer ranged weapon systems that have more lethality and accuracy. We are also looking at upgrading operational logistics systems. The modernisation priorities have been spelt out by my predecessor [Gen. Dalbir Singh] and we are continuing with the same vision and thrust areas because I feel they have been thought through and holistically define the army's requirements.Do you see an emerging threat in the new China-Pakistan proximity and how do you propose to respond to it?National security strategy by any nation is defined by its national interests. China has defined its national interests by coming close to Pakistan in looking for access to the Indian Ocean Region, for energy security, trade. Today, economics defines national strategy and wherever people find economic gain, there are cooperative mechanisms and alliances. We also have to look at our national interests and continue doing whatever is best in our national interests. We will also counter such mechanisms through our own means; our government is quite capable of handling [these]. We are also carrying out actions to negate the nexus developing between China and Pakistan.Would you elaborate on these measures?We are addressing the neighbourhood, the extended neighborhood and the Far West. We are looking at certain countries on China's eastern seaboard, and the Americas. There are groupings that are taking place. While we are proud of being non-aligned, there are times when you have to get into some groupings, which is of course in the domain of foreign policy, so I wouldn't like to really comment. We have masters in foreign policy and they do it really well. Our diplomacy is moving well, the prime minister's focus is on the global arena, we will be able to counter whatever is happening through our foreign policy.What are your expectations from a closer military partnership with the United States?Our expectations are that we must live like friends - the economic partnership will grow stronger and everything else will fall into place. We are sharing expertise but that is more in the field of humanitarian assistance and disaster response. We do try out some joint training as far as counter-insurgency [is concerned]. The US does consider us a lead nation in Counter Insurgency Ops; they have specialisation in special forces operations which we look at. As for equipment, we have a system of global tendering, and I feel we should go for whoever gives us the best. Finally, we should support our domestic industry. What it will depend on is who is willing to come here, share technology and help our domestic industry grow and help us in becoming self-reliant, so we needn't be country-fixated.We have been hearing a lot about the rivalry between the infantry and the armoured corps. Would you set the record straight on this?\n\n\nSummary: General Bipin Rawat, the newly appointed Chief of the Army Staff, discussed various security challenges and his plans to address them. He emphasized the importance of credible deterrence and the need to maintain a balance between defense and offense. He also spoke about the army's China-specific Mountain Strike Corps and its role in maintaining the sanctity of the borders. On the issue of surgical strikes, he stated that the army defines its own thresholds and that the decision to conduct such strikes is taken after careful consideration. He also mentioned the importance of modernization and the need to look at emerging technologies. On the issue of the Cold Start doctrine, he stated that it exists for conventional military operations and that the decision to use it would depend on the situation. He also spoke about the need to counter the emerging threat of the China-Pakistan proximity and the measures being taken to do so. Finally, he emphasized the importance of a closer military partnership with the United States and the need to support domestic industry. On the issue",

Their behaviour, their use of language and their lack of any level of tolerance is something that shames the system of parliamentary democracy every time the House is in session.\nWe elect our MPs to work and ensure that they represent the people; we also recognise that many of them have huge personal agendas. What we need is legislation from our sessions, not just high decibel drivel. And this is exactly what the Indian Parliament has come to. Debates are out of the window and have instead been replaced by duels, often of the non-verbal kind.\nI would imagine some of our MPs are slowly losing a sense of their responsibility but more importantly they stay cocooned, protected by parliamentary privilege. The oratory of parliamentarians such as Nehru, Piloo Mody, Vajpayee has been replaced by a rustic drawl and undignified behaviour.\nCan we change this? I am certain we can. The Speaker needs to be even more firm than he is; members need to be expelled; expunging their comments will not suffice. I also recommend telecast of parliamentary proceedings live through the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which is when you will see how some of our MPs use the House as an effective sleep chamber than a chamber for crafting legislation.\nMPs in India are a favoured lot. And the tragedy is they know it better than anyone else. They get amazing perks: from free travel up to a certain limit to subsidised meals to free telephone calls and free medical benefits \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all on taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money. Some of us may think this justified as they are working hard for us. But when sessions get disrupted as often as they do, when legislation is replaced by rowdy behaviour, all we are left with is their perks and no pro-gress. This is my real worry. At this stage of our development we cannot be subsidising bad behaviour only to remain within the propriety of what has been traditional in a manner of speaking.\nThe only way we can change all this is by urgently indexing all compensation for MPs to the amount of work they do in the House. Recall their perks; remove all the freebies till real work gets done. We are not a nation that can afford for our policy-makers to be using the venerable House as a soap-box at Hyde Park. The day we are able to index compensation to effectiveness we will see a new culture within the Houses. Till then, some of our more accomplished and venerable MPs will be as sad as probably we are, at seeing the gradual demise of yet another great institution in India.\n\n\nSummary: The article criticizes the behavior of Indian MPs, who use parliamentary privilege to disrupt sessions and engage in undignified behavior. The author suggests that the Speaker should be firmer, members should be expelled, and parliamentary proceedings should be telecast live to hold MPs accountable. The author also recommends indexing compensation to the amount of work done in the House to encourage MPs to focus on legislation rather than perks.\n\n[DOC 2] The Indian Parliament is in a state of disarray. The Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, has been adjourned several times in the past few days due to disruptions caused by opposition parties. The disruptions have been caused by the opposition parties' protests against the government's policies, particularly the recent hike in fuel prices.\n\nThe opposition parties have been using various tactics to disrupt the proceedings, including shouting slogans, waving placards, and even attempting to storm the podium. The government has been trying to push through several important bills, including a bill to increase the minimum wage",
    "reference": "Concerns are raised over the disruptive behavior of Members of Parliament (MPs) in India, impacting legislative work. The author suggests solutions like stricter enforcement by the Speaker, expulsion of disruptive members, and live telecasts for enhanced accountability. The piece also proposes linking MPs' compensation to their performance in the House to prioritize responsibilities.\n"

    "prediction": "You are a professional news editor.\nWrite a concise, factual summary of the following Indian news articles.\nAvoid hallucination and repetition.\n\n[DOC 1] In an era where economic disparity is at its peak, one can always rely on the Ambanis to provide the much-needed comic relief. The recent splurge on Anant Ambani\u2019s wedding has once again reminded us why the rich remain rich \u2013 by spending copious amounts of money on events that could rival entire national budgets. How dare they? Let\u2019s dive into the outrage, shall we?\n\nWhen news broke that Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s wealthiest man, had decided to spend a small fortune on his son Anant\u2019s wedding, the collective gasp could be heard across the globe. \u201cHow inconsiderate,\u201d cried the masses, \u201cto spend money that could have been used to solve world hunger on a mere wedding!\u201d\n\nIndeed, it was a sight to behold. Lavish decorations that could have been mistaken for the set of a Bollywood blockbuster, celebrities who charged appearance fees higher than the GDP of some small countries, and an orchestra that probably cost more than a new fleet of Rolls-Royces. Oh, the horror!\n\nOf course, this grandiose display did not sit well with the common man. \u201cWhere is our bailout?\u201d screamed a small business owner, forgetting momentarily that he wouldn\u2019t want to share the limelight with the glitzy guest list. \u201cWhat about the poor?\u201d questioned an armchair activist, conveniently ignoring their penchant for imported avocado toast.\n\nThe public outcry was fierce. Twitter threads, Facebook rants, and WhatsApp forwards spread like wildfire. \u201cHow can they be so out of touch?\u201d they asked, while simultaneously queuing up for the latest iPhone release.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact that the rich should only spend their money on the poor. Extravagance is reserved for the middle class, who can proudly show off their small luxuries without facing the wrath of public scrutiny. The Ambanis\u2019 decision to host a wedding that could feed a small nation was, therefore, a moral affront.\n\nPhilanthropy, after all, is best done quietly and without drawing attention. Unlike a wedding, where privacy is tantamount to scandal. How dare they use their own money to make their own choices? The nerve!\n\nThe first tragedy, of course, lies in the excessive luxury. What society needs now more than ever is for its billionaires to show restraint. The millions of roses imported from the farthest corners of the globe are a clear affront to the simple bouquet enthusiasts. The fleets of private jets ferrying guests have, undoubtedly, caused immense psychological trauma to the humble bike riders of the nation.\n\nIn all this hullabaloo, one might overlook the fact that the money spent on Anant Ambani\u2019s wedding did indeed go back into the economy. Thousands of jobs were created, artisans found work, Justin Beiber, Rihanna, and Bollywood actors found work, and the hospitality industry saw a boom. But let\u2019s not get bogged down by such trivialities. The real issue here is that the rich should feel guilty about their wealth \u2013 and that guilt should translate into a modest, preferably invisible, lifestyle.\n\nImagine the distress of the elite class, whose own weddings now appear humble in comparison. What is a diamond-studded cake when Anant Ambani\u2019s dessert table is a glittering mountain? The deep psychological scars left on the wealthy who must now up their game to remain relevant cannot be understated. Sympathy cards are in order for these besieged souls, struggling under the weight of outshone opulence.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating to note the thin line between envy and indignation. The same people who cry foul over the Ambani\u2019s extravagance wouldn\u2019t bat an eyelid if given the chance to attend such a grand affair. Oh, to rub shoulders with the elite, to be a part of the spectacle! But alas, they are left to watch from afar, simmering in their self-righteous fury.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the Ambani family has engaged in philanthropy, it is, frankly, not enough. Feeding the hungry, providing education, and funding healthcare are all well and good, but what we really need is a billionaire who embraces asceticism. Why build hospitals when one can build modest bamboo huts and set a true example?\n\nAs the echoes of Anant Ambani\u2019s wedding celebrations fade, we are left to ponder the true cost of such opulence. The solution, as always, lies in our collective inaction. Let us sit back, continue to critique from our high horses, and do nothing substantive to address wealth disparity. After all, it\u2019s much easier to bemoan the splurges of the rich than to engage in meaningful societal change. In the end, the tragicomedy of Anant Ambani\u2019s wedding serves as a poignant reminder: the real problem isn\u2019t the billionaires\u2019 spending; it\u2019s our insistence on not looking in the mirror.\n\nSo here\u2019s to the beautiful couple, Radhika Merchant and Anant Ambani, and their fabulously opulent wedding. Stay blessed!\n\nSummary: The article criticizes the Ambani family for spending a large amount of money on Anant Ambani's wedding, arguing that it is an example of the rich getting richer while the poor struggle. The author suggests that the money could have been used to solve world hunger or fund more meaningful philanthropic efforts. The article also pokes fun at the public's reaction to the wedding, suggesting that people are more concerned with appearing virtuous than actually making a difference.\n\n[DOC 2] The Indian government has announced a new initiative to promote entrepreneurship among women. The scheme, titled \"Women Entrepreneurs' Empowerment Program,\" aims to provide financial assistance, mentorship, and training to women who want to start their own businesses.\n\nThe program will be implemented in partnership with various organizations, including the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC), and the Indian Institute of Management (IIM). The government has allocated a budget of Rs 500 crore",

Critics argue that such lavish spending\u2014replete with opulent decorations and high-profile celebrities\u2014should be redirected towards addressing global issues like poverty. Public outcry highlights the irony of the elite's splurges, which are seen as a moral affront, despite the economic benefits of such events, including job creation and industry stimulation. The satire underscores a broader societal issue: the disparity between the rich\u2019s opulence and the public\u2019s expectations for modesty, revealing a deeper discontent with wealth inequality and hypocrisy."

Two special teams sent to Afghanistan to review the security situation last month have, however, ruled out recalling Indians working there. The teams, made up of senior security experts and external affairs ministry officials, have instead recommended that additional security personnel be deployed to ensure the safety of Indians associated with \"humanitarian\" projects.\n \nThe security review was carried out after five Indians took refuge at the Indian consulate in Kandahar (reported in HT) after receiving life threats in December last year. The two doctors and three paramedics attached to the Indian medical mission in the city are still at the consulate but attend the medical mission daily.\n \nWhile in Kabul, the two teams met with local security authorities to discuss ways of enhancing security for Indians attached to projects that can't be halted midway. It has also been decided that intelligence exchange will be intensified.\n\nAccording to sources, it is evident that the threats being issued to Indians to abandon their work and leave Afghanistan are serious and not a \"one-off\" incident. There is reportedly enough evidence gathered by local intelligence and Indian authorities to indicate that these threats are coming from resurgent Taliban groups still active along the Afghan-Pak border.An MEA official has disclosed that the Taliban continues to issue threats to Indians. \"The security situation is far from comfortable. This was known when India started its projects there. At the same time, it is imperative to carry on with the humanitarian work there. Those manning hospitals, dispensaries and involved with road construction projects were fully aware before leaving for Afghanistan that they would have to work under adverse security conditions.\"\n\nAccording to the official, Indian doctors attend to as many as 300 patients a day. The Indian medical mission on the Iran-Afghanistan border is the only place for medical aid in the region.\n\nSummary: India has decided to increase security measures for Indians working on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan after threats were issued to them. Two teams have reviewed the security situation and recommended deploying additional security personnel to ensure their safety.\n\n[DOC 2] India's foreign secretary, Nirupam Sen, has said that the country's relations with Pakistan are \"complex\" and that there is no \"silver bullet\" to resolve the issues between the two nations.\nIndia's foreign secretary, Nirupam Sen, has said that the country's relations with Pakistan are \"complex\" and that there is no \"silver bullet\" to resolve the issues between the two nations.
