Artificial ingredients like petroleum-based dyes can also pose health concerns.\n\n8. Instant Ramen: Convenient and affordable, instant ramen is low in fiber and high in sodium, leading to potential health issues such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol with frequent consumption.\n\n9. Cheap Bread: Inexpensive white bread, often consumed for its addictive qualities due to added sugar, high fat, and salt content, lacks sufficient fiber and may pose health risks when consumed excessively.\n\n10.
